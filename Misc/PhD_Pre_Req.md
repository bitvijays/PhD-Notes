### Scientific Publications

Scientific publications can be of different types:

1. Book
2. Thesis
3. Journal Article: Typically an end product of the research process,
4. A Paper or extended abstract (detail of work is omitted) in a conference or workshop proceedings, or a manuscript: Can be an end-product, but mostly work in progress.

### Charactertics shared by sucessful reserach students

1. show a willingness to read widely, to explore the field broadly beyond their specific topic, to try things out, and to generally take part in the academic community.
2. have the enthusiasm to develop their interest in some area, and then ask for advice on how that interest can be turned into a thesis project.
3. have the ability and persistence to undertake a detailed (and even gruelling) investigation of a specific facet of a larger topic
4. take the initiative in terms of what needs to be done and how to present it, and gradually assume responsibility for all aspects of the research
5. systematic and organized, and understand the need for rigour, discipline, stringency, quality, and high standards.
6. they actively reflect on habits and working practices, and seek to improve themselves and overcome their limitations and knowledge gaps.
7. work looks plausible; it has the form and feel of high-quality published papers
8. Have the strength to keep working despite some significant failed or unsuccessful activity; in a Ph.D., loss of months of work is not unusual.
9. Note that neither “brilliance” nor “genius” is in this list.


#### Co-authoring

The inclusion of several people as authors means that, in principle, all these people contributed in some significant way to the intellectual content of the paper. In many cases, it also means that the task of writing was shared.


In cases where researchers are working more or less as equals, one strategy is
to brainstorm the contents of the paper, then for each author to write a designated section

Another strategy—my preferred model for collaboration—is to take turns. One person writes a draft, the next revises and extends, and so on, with each person holding an exclusive lock on the paper while amending it.

#### Theses

A thesis (or dissertation) is how research students present their work for examination.

The questions that examiners respond to are much the same as those a referee
would ask of a paper.

A thesis passes (or fails) on the strength of your demonstration of competence; even if good results are not achieved, the thesis should pass if you have shown the ability to undertake high-quality research. Questions that examiners might be asked to address include whether you have demonstrated command of the fundamentals of the discipline, whether you have the ability to correctly interpret results, and whether you have sufficiently strong communication skills.

In a paper, the primary element is the contribution: whether the research is novel, interesting, and correct. In a thesis, the primary element is the competence: whether the student has demonstrated that they are capable of undertaking indepen- dent research.
