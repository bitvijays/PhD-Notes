# Getting Started

1. Formation of a precise question aka the aim of the research.
2. Development of a detailed understanding: Literature Review/ Related work - reading and critical analysis of scientific literature and other resources.
3. Gathering of evidence related to the question, through experiment, analysis, or theory. These are intended to support—or disprove—the hypothesis underlying the question.
4. Linking of the question and evidence with an argument, that is, a chain of reasoning.
5. Description of the work in a publication.

Experienced scientists aiming to write a paper on a reserach subject tend to be fairly focused: they quickly design a series of experiments or theoretical goals, investigate the relevant literature, and set deadlines.

Larger research program such as a Ph.D., there are

- short-term goals: Include the current specific explorations, which may be intended to lead to an initial research paper; short-term research goals gives shape to a research program.
- long-term goals: are the wider investigation that will eventually form the basis of the student’s thesis.

Typical research project has just one deadline: completion! There might be few administrative requirements such as submission of a project outline or a progress report, but many students (and advisors) do not take these milestones seriously.

PhD Thesis is the only part which is assessed. It is a mistake, for example, to implement a complete system rather than ask what code is needed to explore the research questions.
explicitly consider what is needed at the end, then reason backwards. The final thing required is the write-up in the form of a thesis, paper, or report; so you need to plan in terms of the steps necessary to produce the write-up. the write-up is likely to involve a background review, explanations ofprevious and newalgorithms, descriptions of experiments, and analysis of outcomes. Completion of each of these elements is a milestone.

## Getting Started Checklist

- Is your proposed topic clearly a research activity? Is it consistent with the aims and purposes of research?
- How is your project different from, say, software development, essay writing, or data analysis?
- In the context of your project, what are the area, topic, and research question? (How are these concepts distinct from each other?)
- Is the project of appropriate scale, with challenges that are a match to your skills and interests? Is the question narrowenough to give you confidence that the project is achievable?
- Is the project distinct from other active projects in your research group? Is it clear that the anticipated outcomes are interesting enough to justify the work?
- Is it clear what skills and contributions you bring to the project, and what will be contributed by your advisor? What skills do you need to develop?
- What resources are required and how will you obtain them? • What are the likely obstacles to completion, or the greatest difficulties? Do you know how these will be addressed?
- Can you write down a road map, with milestones, that provides a clear path to the anticipated research outcomes?
- Do you and your advisor have an agreed method for working together, with a defined schedule of meetings?
