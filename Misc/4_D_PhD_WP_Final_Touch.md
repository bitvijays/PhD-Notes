# Writing Paper - Final Touch

The paper is polished by correcting mistakes, improving written expression, and taking care of layout. The styling of the paper  -  that has the most impact on a reader.

The difference between a weak writer and a strong writer is, often, not the ability to write fluently, but the effort taken to diligently edit and revise.

## Consistency

Editing is the process of making a document ready for publication or examination. Much of editing consists of checking the document for errors that fall under the heading of consistency (or lack of it).

A surprisingly effective editing exercise is to pretend to be a reader, a member of the paper's intended audience. This shift of framework, of consciously adopting the position of critic, often exposes problems that otherwise go unnoticed.

For many papers, editing leads to removal of text. Don't be afraid to shorten your papers: cutting will improve the quality. Edit for brevity and balance. Omit or condense any material whose content or relevance to the paper's main themes does not justify its length.

## Style

Another kind of editing is for style and clarity, and is perhaps the hardest part of finishing a paper.

## Proofreading

There is no excuse for a report that contains spelling errors. They jump out and glare, displaying not only your inability to spell, but also your casual attitude to your work.

But spell checkers won't find missing words, repeated words, or misused words, or correctly handle names. Nor will they find misspellings that form another correct word; a typical example is the substitution of "or" for "on" or "of".

A common error of mine is, when intending to type a word, to instead type
some other word that shares a few initial letters. A related error is that of replacing words by their anagrams; I type "being" for "begin", "form" for "from", "relation" for "relative", "compute" for "complete", and so on. I also replace words by their homonyms, such as "two" for "too".

Typical examples include incomplete sentences and sentences that have been run together inappropriately. Check for errors in tense and in number, that is, in the use of plural and singular forms.

Many papers are completed without ever having been printed, but most people read more carefully away from the computer than they do at a screen - if only because there are fewer distractions. It is vital to read your paper at least once in its entirety, to check flow and consistency. Set the draft aside for a day or two before proofreading it yourself, as doing so increases the likelihood of finding mistakes.

Read each sentence carefully, and ask yourself how easy it is to understand.

It is particularly important to check the bibliography. Readers will use it to track down references, so any garbling of information can lead them astray, and other writers may be offended if you have misreferenced their papers. Format should be consistent and each reference should include enough information to allow readers to locate it.

Always get someone else to read your work before you submit it or distribute it.

## An "Editing" Checklist

- Are all of the components present: title, authors, abstract, and so on?
- Are the acknowledgements complete and accurate?
- Is the ordering of material correct?
- Are the titles and headings consistent with the content?
- Have all terms been defined?
- Is the style of definition consistent? For example, were all new terms introduced in italics, or only some?
- Has terminology been used consistently?
- Are defined objects always described in the same way? For example, if you use the expression "all regular elements E" when introducing a concept, but the shorter form "all elements E" in later references, is "regular" implicit in the latter expression?
- Are abbreviations and acronyms stated in full when first used? Are any abbreviations or acronyms introduced more than once? Are the full statements subsequently used unnecessarily?
- Are any abbreviations used less than, say, four times? If not, can they be removed?
- Do all headings have maximum or minimum capitalization? Has a term been capitalized in one place and not in another?
- Is the style and wording of headings and captions consistent?
- Are names always used in the same way? Has a consistent convention been used for the formation of new names?
- Is spelling consistent? What about "-ise" versus "-ize", "dispatch" versus "despatch", or "disc" versus "disk"?
- Is tense used correctly? Are references discussed in a consistent way?
- Have bold and italic been used logically?
- Are any words hyphenated in some places but not others?
- Have units been used logically? If milliseconds have been used for some measurements and microseconds for others, is there a logical reason for doing so? Is the reason clear to the reader? Has "megabyte" been written as "Mb" in some places and "Mbyte" in others?
- Are all values of the same type presented with the same precision?
- Are the graphs all the same size? Are the axis units always given? If, say, the x-axes on different graphs measure the same units, do the axes have the same label?
- Are all tables in the same format? Does the use of double and single lines follow a logical pattern? Are units given for every value? Are labels and headings named consistently? If, say, columns have been used for properties A to E in one table, have rows been used elsewhere? That is, do all tables have the same orientation?
- Does every figure and table have a caption?
- Has the same style been used for all algorithms and programs? Is there a consistent scheme for naming of variables? Do all pseudocode statements have the same syntax? Is the use of indentation consistent?
- In the references, has each field been formatted consistently? Have italics and quotes been used appropriately for titles? Is capitalization consistent? Are journal and conference names abbreviated in the same way? Is the style of author names consistent? Has the same core set of fields been provided for each reference of the same type?
- Is formatting consistent? Has the same indentation been used for all displays? Are some displays centred and others indented? Do some sections begin with an unindented paragraph and others not?
- Do the parentheses match?
