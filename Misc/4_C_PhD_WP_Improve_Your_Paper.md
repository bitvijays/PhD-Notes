## Good Style

### Economy

- Text should be taut.
- The length of a paper should reflect its content — it is admirable to use only as many words as are required. Every sentence should be necessary.
- Taut writing is a consequence of careful, frequent revision.

#### Checklist - Economy

- Aim to delete superfluous words, simplify sentence structure, and establish a logical flow.

### Tone

- Science writing should be objective and accurate.
- Many of the elements that give literature its strength — nuance, ambiguity, metaphor, sensuality — are inappropriate for technical work.

#### Checklist - Tone

Simple writing follows from a few simple rules:

- Have one idea per sentence or paragraph and one topic per section.
- Have a straightforward, logical organization.
- Use short words.
- Use short sentences with simple structure.
- Keep paragraphs short.
- Avoid buzzwords, clichés, and slang.
- Avoid excess, in length or style.
- Omit unnecessary material.
- Be specific, not vague or abstract.
- Break these rules if there is a good reason to do so.

Use direct statements and expressions involving “we” or “I” —that is, the active voice — to make reading more pleasant and to help distinguish new results from old.

### Examples

- Use an example whenever it adds clarification.
- A small example often means the difference between communication and confusion, particularly if the concept being illustrated is fundamental to understanding the paper.
- People learn by generalizing from concrete instances, and examples can give substance to abstract concepts.

### Motivation

- The introduction usually gives some indication of the organization of the paper, by outlining the results and their context, and may include a list of the parts of the paper, but these measures by themselves are not sufficient.
- Brief summaries at the start and end of each section are helpful, as are sentences connecting one section to the next;
- Link text together as a narrative — each section should have a clear story to tell. The connection between one paragraph and the next should be obvious. This principle is sometimes expressed as: Tell the reader what you are going to say, then say it, and then tell the reader that you have said it

### Balance

Within a paper, each topic should be discussed to a similar depth.

### Voice

#### Checklist - Voice

- Avoid excessive use of indirect statements (passive voice), particularly descriptions of actions that don’t indicate who or what performs them. The direct style (active voice) is often less stilted and easier to read.

- Another unpleasant indirect style is the artificial use of verbs like “perform” or “utilize”, perhaps in the false belief that such writing is more precise or scientific.

- Other words often used in this way include “achieved”, “carried out”, “conducted”, “done”, “occurred”, and “effected”.

- Some authors use phrases such as “this paper shows” and “this section argues”. These phrases, with their implication that the paper, not the author, is doing the arguing, should generally be avoided.

#### Acceptable - Voice

- Use of “we” is valuable when trying to distinguish between the contribution made in your paper and existing results in a field, particularly in an abstract or introduction.

- Use of “we” can allow some kinds of statements to be simplified — consider “we show” versus “in this paper it is shown that”. “We” is preferable to pretentious expressions such as “the authors”.

### Obfuscation

- In science writing, vague statements are regrettably common.
- It is always preferable to be specific:
  - exceptions are or are not possible,
  - data was transmitted at a certain rate, and so on.
- Obfuscation can arise in other ways: exaggeration, omission of relevant information, or bold statements of conclusions based on flimsy evidence.

#### Checklist - Obfuscation

- Stating that “there may be exceptions in some circumstances” or “data was transmitted fast” is not helpful.

### Analogies

- Analogies are curious things: what seems perfectly alike or parallel to one person may seem entirely unalike to another.

### Straw Men

- A straw man is an indefensible hypothesis that an author describes for the sole purpose of criticizing it.
- A paraphrasing of an instance in a published paper is “it can be argued that databases do not require indexes”, in which the author and reader are well aware that a database without an index is as practical as a library without a catalogue.
- Another form of strawman is the contrasting of a new idea with some impossibly bad alternative, to put the new idea in a favourable light.
- A more subtle form of straw man is comparison between the new and the ancient.
- A strawman is an example of rhetoric—ofattempting towin an argument through presentation rather than reasoning. Other forms of rhetoric are appeal to authority, appeal to intuitively obvious truth, and presentation of received wisdom as fact.
- If there is evidence — a study or proof, not someone else’s opinion — then cite it. Unsubstantiated claims should be clearly noted as such, not dressed up as accepted knowledge.

#### Checklist - Straw Men

- Avoid nonsense, absurdity, and over-generalization.
- Example:
  - Execution was almost instantaneous.
  - The Web is infinitely large.
  - There is no limit to the possible efficiency gains.

### Reference and Citations

#### References

- Refer to
  - an original paper in preference to a secondary source;
  - to well-written material in preference to bad;
  - to a book, conference paper, or journal article in preference to a workshop paper;
  - to a workshop paper in preference to a manuscript (which have the disadvantage of being unrefereed); and
  - to formally published documents rather than Web pages.

- Avoid reference to private communications and information provided in forums such as seminars or talks—such information cannot be accessed or verified by the reader. In the rare circumstance that you must refer to such material, do so via a footnote, parenthetical remark, or acknowledgement.

- On rare occasions it is necessary to refer to a result in an inaccessible paper.

- Cited material often uses different terminology, spelling, or notation, or is written for an entirely different context. When you use results from other papers, be sure to show the relationship to your own work.

- References that are discussed should not be anonymous.

   ```
   X - Other work [16] has used an approach in which…
   Y - Marsden [16] has used an approach in which…
   ```

- Likewise, self-references should not be anonymous — it should be clear to the reader that references used to support your argument are your own papers, not independent authorities.

#### Citation

Citations can be done in three styles:

- One is the ordinal-number style, in which entries in the reference list are numbered and are cited by their number, as in “…is discussed elsewhere [16]”.
- The other is the name-and-date or Harvard style. Preferred style — in which entries are cited by author name using either square or round brackets:
- A third common style is to use superscripted ordinal numbers, as in “… is discussed elsewhere16”.

- When discussing a reference with more than two authors, all but the first author’s name can be replaced by “et al.” In a variant of this style, the full list is given at the first citation, and the abbreviated form thereafter. Note the stop: “et al.” is an abbreviation.

**Citing details:**

- Journal articles. The journal name should be given in full, and author names, paper title, year, volume, number, and pages must be provided. Consider also giving the month. Thus:

- Conference papers. The conference name should be complete, and authors, title, year, and pages must be provided. Information such as publisher, conference location, month, and editors should also be given.

- Books. Give title, authors, publisher, year, and, where relevant, edition and volume. If the reference is to a specific part of the book, give page numbers; for example write “(Howing 1994; pp. 22–31)” rather than just “(Howing 1994)”. If the reference is to a chapter, give its title, pages, and, if applicable, authors.

- Technical reports. In addition to title, authors, year, and report number, you need to provide the address of the publisher (which is usually the authors’ home institution). If the report is available online, give its URL.

- Web pages. If you cite a Web page, attempt to find a durable URL that is unlikely to change if, for example, a researcher changes institution. In addition to the usual details, give theURL; they can include unusual characters, somake sure you represent these correctly. It is a preferred practice to also include the date on which the Web page was accessed. However, as for technical reports, it is usually better to refer to such material in a footnote rather than as a formal entry in a bibliography. You should still provide sufficient details, of course, and a durable URL.

### Quotation

- Quotations are text from another source, usually included in a paper to support an argument.
- The copied text, if short, is enclosed in double quotes (which are more visible than single quotes and cannot be confused with apostrophes).
- Longer quotes are set aside in an indented block.

### Acknowledgements

In the acknowledgements of a write-up you should thank everyone who made a contribution, whether advice, proofreading, coding, or whatever: include research students, research assistants, technical support, and colleagues. Funding sources should also be acknowledged.

There are two common forms of acknowledgement:

- One is to simply list the people who have helped with the paper.
- The other common form is to explain each person’s contribution.

#### Checklist - Acknowledgements

- Some authors write their thanks as “I would like to thank” or “I wish to thank”.
- This seems to imply that I wish to thank …but for some reason I am unable to do so. Consider instead using “I am grateful to” or simply “I thank” or “Thanks to”.

## Style Specfics

Good style is about clear, easy-to-read writing, which can be achieved by following well-defined guidelines.

### Titles and Headings

- Titles of papers and sections should be concise and informative, have specific rather than general terms, and accurately describe the content.

- The title is the only part of your paper that most people see; if the title does not reflect the paper’s contents, the paper will not be read by the intended readership.

- The title is meant to capture something of the flavour of the contribution, and should not be misleading as to the scope or outcome of the work.

- Section headings should reflect the paper’s structure.

- Headings may or may not be numbered. In a paper, preference is to use only two levels of headings, major and minor, and to only number major headings.

  - In a thesis, numbered chapters, sections, and possibly subsections, are appropriate.
  - A paper (or thesis chapter) consists of sections and possibly subsections. There is rarely any need to break subsections into sub-subsections.

### The Opening Paragraphs

- The opening paragraphs can set the reader’s attitude to the whole paper or thesis, so begin well.
- All of a document should be created and edited with care, but take the most care with the opening, to create the best possible first impression.
- The abstract should be written especially well, without an unnecessary word, and the opening sentence should be direct and straightforward.

- The first paragraphs must be intelligible to any likely reader; save technicalities for later on, so that readers who don’t understand the details of your paper are still able to appreciate your results and the importance of your work. That is, describe what you have done without the details of how it was done.

- A typical organization for the introduction of a paper is to use the first paragraphs to describe the context. It is these paragraphs that convince the reader that the paper is likely to be interesting. The opening sentences should clearly indicate the topic.

- Take care to distinguish description of existing knowledge from the description of the paper’s contribution.

#### Checklist - The Opening Paragraphs

- Starting an abstract or introduction with “This paper concerns” or “In this paper” often means that results are going to be stated out of context.

### Variation

- Diversity — in organization, structure, length of sentences and paragraphs, and word choice — helps to keep the reader’s attention.

### Paragraphing

- A paragraph should discuss a single topic or issue.
- The outline or the argument is typically captured in the first sentence of each paragraph, with the rest of the paragraph used for amplification or example.
- Every sentence in a paragraph should be on the topic announced in the opening.
- The last sentence has higher impact than those in the body, so pay attention to sentence order.

- Contextual information can be forgotten between paragraphs, and references between paragraphs can be difficult to follow.

#### Formatted Lists

- Formatted lists can be used as an occasional alternative to paragraphs.
- Lists are useful for the following reasons:
  - They highlight each main point clearly.
  - The context remains obvious, whereas, in a long list of points made in a paragraph, it is hard to tell whether the later points are part of the original issue or belong to some subsequent discussion.
  - An individual point can be considered in detail without confusing the main thread of narrative.
  - They are easy to refer to.

- List points can be numbered, named, or tagged. Use numbers only when ordering or reference is important. If it is necessary to refer to an individual point, use numbers or names. Otherwise use tags, as in the list above.
- Acceptable tags are bullets and dashes;
- Reserve lists for material that is both significant and in need of enumeration.

### Ambiguity

- Check carefully for ambiguity.
- When using pronouns such as “it”, “this”, and “they”, ensure that the reader knows what is being referred to.
- Another problem with “it” is that it is overused.

#### Checklist - Ambiquity

- A common source of confusion is between speed and time. Although not ambiguous, the phrase “increasing speed” is easily read as increasing time, which has the opposite meaning. There are similar problems with phrases such as “improving affordability”.

### Sentence Structure

- Sentences should have simple structure, which usually means that they will be no more than a line or two.
- Sometimes longer sentences can be divided by, say, simply replacing an “and” or a semicolon with a full stop. If there is no particular reason to join two sentences, keep them separate. Beware of misplaced modifier.

- Organize your sentences so that they can be parsed without too much backtracking. Ambiguous words or phraseology, even if clear in the context of a whole sentence, can slow the reader down.

- Build your text from simple sentences and concise paragraphs.
- To guide analysis of your writing, ask elementary questions about it.
  - Is each sentence motivated by the preceding text?
  - Can you identify the sentence’s purpose, that is, is it necessary?
  - Could it be simplified? And so on.
- The habit of careful examination of your text can greatly improve your writing.

#### Checklist - Sentence Structure

- It is likewise helpful to avoid nested sentences, that is, information embedded within a sentence that is not part of its main statement.
- Nested content, particularly if in parentheses, should be omitted. If such content really is required, then put it in a separate sentence.
- If an “-ing” suffix can be replaced by “-ation of”, then it is probably a good idea to do so. Example below
  - In this context, developing tools is not an option.
  - In this context, development of tools is not an option.

### Tense

- In science writing, most text is in past or present tense. Present tense is used for eternal truths.
- Past tense is used for describing work and outcomes.
- Present tense is also used for statements about the text itself. It is better to write “related issues are discussed below” than to write “related issues will be discussed below”.

### Repetition and Parallelism

- Text that consists of the same form of sentence used again and again is monotonous.
- There are some standard forms of parallel.
  - The phrase “on the one hand” should have a matching “on the other hand”.
  - A sentence beginning “One …” suggests that a sentence beginning “Another …” is imminent.
  - If you flag a point with “First” then every following point should have a similar flag, such as “Second”, “Next”, or “Last”.
- Parallel structures should be used in lists.

#### Checklist - Repetition and Parallelism

- Watch out for sequences of sentences beginning with “however”, “moreover”, “therefore”, “hence”, “thus”, “and”, “but”, “then”, “so”, “nevertheless”, or “nonetheless”.
- Likewise, don’t overuse the pattern “First, … Second, … Last, …”. Complementary concepts should be explained as parallels, or the reader will have difficulty seeing how the concepts relate to each other.

### Emphasis

- The structure of a sentence places implicit emphasis, or stress, on some words. Reorganization of a sentence can change the emphasis.

#### Checklist - Emphasis

- Explicit stress can be provided with italics, but is almost never necessary.
- Don’t italicize words unnecessarily — let sentence structure provide the emphasis.
- Few papers require explicit stress more than once or twice.
- DON’T use capitals for emphasis.
- Some authors use the word “emphatic” to provide emphasis, as in “which are emphatically not equivalent”.
- Other words used in this way are “certainly” and “indeed”.
- The resulting wordiness weakens rather than strengthens; use of this form of emphasis should be rare.

### Definitions

- Terminology, variables, abbreviations, and acronyms should be defined or explained the first time they are used.
- Definitions should be specific and concrete.

### Choice of Words

- Use short, direct words rather than long, circumlocutionary ones; the result is vigorous, emphatic writing.
- Use short words in preference to long, but use an exact long word rather than an approximate short one.
- A common reason for using vague terms is that some authors feel they are writing badly if they use the same word twice in a sentence or paragraph, and thus substitute a synonym, which is usually less specific.
- The “don’t repeat words” rule might apply to creative writing, but not to technical terms that must be clearly understood.

### Avoid - Choice of Words

- For example, use “begin” rather than “initiate”, “first” and “second” rather than “firstly” and “secondly”, “part” rather than “component”, and “use” rather than “utilize”.
- Other abstract terms that are overused include “important”, “intelligent”, “method”, “paradigm”, “performance”, and “semantic”.
- “Difficult” is often used when a better term is available: if something is “difficult to compute”, does that mean that it is slow, or memory-hungry, or requires double precision, or something else altogether?
- “Hard” is sometimes used poorly too, including cases when “difficult” would be a better choice; remember that “hard” also means inflexible or rigid and can be misunderstood. “Efficient” is another word that is often vague. Use the most precise term available.
- Use a word only if you are sure that you know the meaning and can apply it correctly. Other words, such as “notwithstanding”, “whilst”, and “amongst”, have an archaic feel and can seem out of place in newwriting.
- Slang should not be used in technical writing. Nor should the choice of words suggest that the writing is careless; avoid sloppy-looking abbreviations and contractions. Use “cannot” in preference to “can’t”, for example.
- Don’t make excessive claims about your own work. Phrases such as “our method is an ideal solution to these problems” or “our work is remarkable” are not acceptable. Claims about your own work should be unarguable.

### Qualifiers

- Don’t pile qualifiers on top ofone another.
- Within a sentence, use atmost one qualifier such as “might”, “may”, “perhaps”, “possibly”, “likely”, “likelihood”, or “could”.
- Overuse of qualifiers results in text that is lame and timid.
- Double negatives are a form of qualifier; they are commonly used to express uncertainty.

#### Checklist - Qualifiers

- Qualifiers such as “very” and “quite” should be avoided, because they are in effect meaningless. If an algorithm is “very fast”, is an algorithm that is merely “fast” deficient in some way? Writing is invariably more forceful without “very”.
- Likewise, “simply” can often be deleted.
- Other words of this kind are “totally”, “completely”, “truly”, “highly”, “usually”, “accordingly”, “certainly”, “necessarily”, and “somewhat”.

### Misused Words

XX

The Table lists words that are often used incorrectly because of confusion with another word of similar form or sound. The “usually correct” form is shown on the left; the form with which each word gets confused is shown on the right.

Which, that, the. Many writers use “which” when “that” is appropriate. Use “which” only when it cannot be replaced by “that”.

The word “that” is often underused. Use of “that” can make a sentence seem stilted, but its absence can make the sentence unclear.

On the other hand, “the” is often used unnecessarily; delete it where doing so does not change the meaning.

Less, fewer. Use “less” for continuous quantities (“it used less space”) and “fewer” for discrete quantities (“there were fewer errors”).

Affect, effect. The “effect”, or consequence, of an action is to “affect”, or influence, outcomes.
Alternate, alternative, choice. The word “alternate” means other or switch between, whereas an “alternative” is something that can be chosen. Strictly speaking, if there is only one alternative, no choice is available; “alternative” and “choice” are not synonyms.
Assume, presume. “Assume” means for now, take as being true, while “presume” means take for granted. A fact is assumed as the basis of an argument, an event is presumed to have occurred.
May, might, can. Many writers use “may” or “might” when they mean “can”. Use “may” to indicate personal choice, and “can” to indicate capability.

Basic, fundamental. Somewriters confuse “basic”with “fundamental”: the former means elementary as well as a foundation. A result should only be described as “basic” if elementary is meant, or readers may get the wrong idea.
Novel, complex, sophisticated. “Sophisticated” does not mean new or novel,but either advanced or complex. Use “novel” or “complex” if these meanings are intended.
Will, shall. The word “shall” can seem archaic and is rarely preferable to “will”. Both “will” and “shall” are often used unnecessarily and in many cases can be deleted.
Compile, compose. In general usage, “compile” means assemble, gather,or col- lect, but it has such a strong specific meaning in computing that it should not be used for other purposes. To “compose” is to invent or perhaps prepare; it is not a synonym of “compile”, even though “composed of” means made up of.
Conflate, merge, confuse. The word “conflate” means regard distinct things as similar, while “merge” means join distinct things to form one new thing.Iftwo things are “confused”, then one has been mistaken for the other. These three terms are not equivalent.
Continual, continuous. “Continual” is not equivalent to “continuous”. The former means ceaselessly; the latter means unbroken.
Conversely, inversely, similarly, likewise. Only use “conversely” if the statement that follows really is the opposite of the preceding material. Don’t use “similarly” or “likewise” unless whatever follows has a strong parallel to the preceding material. Some authors use “inversely”, but the meaning is rarely clear; avoid it.

Fast, quickly, presently, timely, currently. A process is “fast” if it runs quickly; “quickly” means fast, but does not necessarily mean in the near future. Something is “timely” if it is opportune; timeliness has nothing to do with rapidity. Also on the subject of time, “presently” means soon, whereas “currently” means at present.

Optimize, minimize, maximize. Absolute terms are often misused. One suchword is “optimize”, whichmeans findan optimum or find the best solution, but is often used to mean improve. The latter usage is now so common that it could be argued that the meaning of“optimize” has changed, but as there is no synonym for “optimize” such a change would be unfortunate. Other absolute terms that are misused are “maximize” and “minimize”.
Overlook, oversee, oversight. To “overlook” is to fail to notice, or to ignore.To “oversee” is to manage or look after. They are not synonyms! Even more confusingly, “oversight” means both of these things.4
Theory, hypothesis, proposition, supposition. These words are used in a wide variety ofways across the discipline. In some areas, “theory” is used in a strict sense, of a hypothesis that has been confirmed by analysis or experiment. But in some areas it is used more or less equivalently to “proposition”, in the sense ofa concept that is to be tested. Sometimes “proposition” is used to mean assumption, as is “supposition”. That is, these terms are used both formally and loosely, in ways that can be deeply inconsistent with each other. As in other cases, be alert to the conventions within your discipline, but it is helpful to use these terms in ways that are consistent with their formal meaning, as they are part of the fundamental principles of science.

### Spelling Conventions

- A finished manuscript should as nearly as possible be free of spelling errors.
- To ensure that all errors have been found it is essential to use a spell checker, but you should also take the effort to find mistakes by hand.

#### Checklist - Spelling Conventions

- Other words that don’t have a stable spelling include “enquire” (“inquire”), “biased” (“biassed”), and “dispatch” (“despatch”).

- The English-speaking countries have different spelling conventions. For example, the American “traveler” becomes the British “traveller” while “fulfill” becomes “fulfil”. In Britain it is incorrect to spell “-our” words as “-or”, but, for example, “vigour” and “vigorous” are both correct.5 TheAmerican “center” is the British “centre”, “pro- gram” is “programme” (except for computer program), “catalog” and “analog” are “catalogue” and “analogue”, “acknowledgment” is “acknowledgement”, and “judg- ment” is “judgement”. Another confusion is with regard to the suffixes “-ize” and “-yze”, which have the same recommended spelling in both countries, but are often spelt as “-ise” and “-yse” outside the United States

- The most important thing is to spell consistently and to be consistent with suffixes such as “-ize” without introducing errors such as “expertize” or “otherwize”.

### Jargon

- The word “jargon” means terms used in a specialized vocabulary or mode ofspeech familiar only to a group or profession.

### Cliché and Idiom

- Some expressions are clichés, that is, stock phrases whose meaning has little relationship to their words. Many readers, especially those from other cultures, may misunderstand such phrases.
- Examples include “follow suit”, “up to scratch”, “reinvent the wheel”, “go through with a fine-tooth comb”, “flat out”, “cut and dried”, and “bells and whistles”.
- Idiomatic phrases are also poor choices in scientific writing, for similar reasons. Examples include “crop up”, “lose track”, “come to grips with”, “it turned out that”, “play up”, “stacked deck”, and “right out”.
- Do not use such phrases.

### Overuse of Words

- Repetition of a word is annoying when it makes the reader feel they have read the same phrase twice, or have read a phrase and an inversion of it.
- Repetition should be eliminated when the same word is used in different senses, or when a word and a synonym of it are used together.

#### Checklist - Overuse of Words

- Some words grate when they are used too frequently. Common offenders include “this”, “very”, and “case”.
- Other words are even more memorable — unusual words, other than technical terms, should only be used once or twice in a paper.
- Watch out for tics: excessive use of some stockword or phrase. Typical tics include “so”, “also”, “hence”, “note that”, and “thus”.

There are cases in which repetition is useful. In the phrase “discrete quantities and continuous quantities”, the first “quantities” can be omitted, but such omissions are often ambiguous and can result in text that is difficult to parse.

### Padding

XX

- Padding is the unnecessary use of pedantic phrases such as “in general”, which should usually be deleted, not least because they are irritating.

- The phrase “of course” can be patronizing or even insulting — “of course it is now clear that that the order is stable”.
- The phrases “note that” and “the fact that” are not padding, but are often used to introduce something that readers should be able to deduce for themselves.
- Phrases involving the word “case” (“in any case”, “it is perhaps the case”) are also suspect.
- There is rarely a reason to use “it is frequently the case that” instead of “often”, for example.
- Unnecessary introduction of quantities, or the concept of quantities, is a form of padding. For example, the phrase “a number of” can be replaced by “several”, and “a large number of” by “many”.
- Adjectives are another form of padding.
- Use the minimum number of words, of minimum length, in your writing.

The Table lists common redundant or wordy expressions and possible substitutes for them.

### Plurals

- A common problem in English for writers educated in another language is agreement of plurals —a plural noun can require a differently formed verb to that required by a singular noun.

- Consider proofreading your paper just to check for plural agreement.

### Abbreviations

#### Checklist - Abbreviations

- It is often tempting to use abbreviations such as “no.”, “i.e.”, “e.g.”, “c.f.”, and “w.r.t.” These save a little space on the page, but slow readers down.
- It is almost always desirable to expand these abbreviations, to “number”, “that is”, “for example”, “compared with” (or more accurately “in contrast to”, since that is the sense in which “c.f.” should be used), and “with respect to”, or synonyms of these expressions.

- Also consider expanding abbreviations such as “Fig.” and “Alg.” (but note that the contracted form is the preferred style for some journals), and don’t use concoctions such as “1st” or “2nd”.
- Months should not be abbreviated. Make sure that all abbreviations and acronyms are explained when they are first used.

- Avoid use of “etc.” and “and so on”. They are clumsy, and sometimes patronizing, as they can imply that the reader ought to be able to complete the list without the author’s help.

- A slash, also known as a virgule or solidus, is often used for abbreviation, as in “save time and/or space” or “used for list/tree processing”.
- Use of slashes betrays confusion, since it is often not clear whether the intended meaning is or (in the usual English sense of either but not both), or (in the usual computing sense of either or both), and, or also.
- If you want to be clear, don’t use slashes.
  - An exception is “I/O”, meaning input and output.

### Acronyms

- In technical documents with many compound terms it can be helpful to use acronyms, but as with abbreviations they can confuse the reader.

#### Checklist - Acronyms

- Abbreviations end with a stop but it is unusual to put stops in acronyms.
- Thus “CPU” is correct, “C.P.U.” is acceptable, and “CPU.” is incorrect.
- Plurals of acronyms don’t require an apostrophe; write “CPUs” rather than “CPU’s”.

### Sexism

- Forms of expression that unnecessarily specify gender are widely regarded as sexist. In technical writing, sexist usage is easy to avoid.
- The first use of “they”, as a singular pronoun, is acceptable but, to some readers, jarring.
- The second use, as a plural, removes sexism at the cost of clarity. It is preferable to recast the sentence.

#### Checklist - Sexism

- Don’t use ugly constructs such as “s/he” or engage in reverse sexism by using “she” unless it is absolutely impossible to avoid a generic reference. - Remember that some readers find use of “he” or “his” for a generic case offensive and dislike writing that employs such usage.

## Punctuation

### Checklist - Punctuation

- Some authors prefer bold to italic for emphasis, but bold print is distracting.

- Visual clutter of any kind is distracting and should be eliminated unless there is a clear need for it. Emphasis is one kind of clutter.
- Another is the use of graphic devices such as boxes around important points or icons next to results.
- Yet another kind of clutter is punctuation: excessive use of parentheses, quotes, italics, hyphens, semicolons, and uppercase letters.

- Indentation is an important tool of layout, used primarily to indicate the start of a new paragraph.
- Some authors prefer to use a blank line instead, a decision that is often unwise; the meaning is unclear at a page break, for example. Changes of topic should be signalled by headings.
- Indentation is also used to offset material that is not part of the textual flow, such as quotes, programs, and displayed mathematics.

### Stops

- Stops (or full-stops or periods) end sentences.
- Stops are also used in abbreviations, acronyms, and ellipses. When these occur at the end of sentence, the sentence’s stop is omitted. Problems with stops are a good reason to avoid abbreviations.

#### Checklist - Stops

- It is not usual to put a stop at the end of a heading.

### Commas

- The primary uses of commas are to mark pauses, indicate the correct parsing, form lists, and indicate that a phrase is a parenthetical remark (that is, a comment) rather than a qualifier.
- Use the minimum number of commas needed to avoid ambiguity. Sentences with many commas often have strangulated syntax; if the commas seem necessary, consider breaking the sentence into shorter ones or rewriting it altogether. But don’t omit too many commas.

#### Checklist - Commas

- Another exception to the minimal-commas rule is in lists. A simple example of a list is “the structures were arrays, trees, and hash tables”.
- Many authors (and editors) prefer to omit the last comma from a list, known as the serial comma, a process that rarely adds clarity and often does it serious damage.

### Colons and Semicolons

- Colons are used to join related statements.
- Colons are also used to introduce lists.
- The elements in a list can be separated by semicolons, allowing commas or other marks within each element.
- A semicolon can also be used to divide a long sentence, or to set off part of a sentence for emphasis.

#### Checklist - Colons and Semicolons

- Colons and semicolons are valuable but should not be overused.

### Apostrophes

#### Checklist - Apostrophes

- Singular possessives such as “the student’s algorithm”, “Brandt’s book”, and “Su and Ling’s method” require an apostrophe and an “s”. (Some people would write “Su’s and Ling’s method”, which is fine too.)
- For some names ending in “-s”, such as in “Williams’s book”, you can optionally omit the “s” after the apostrophe. If you are unsure, then the “s” should be given.
- Plural possessives such as “students’ passwords” require an apostrophe but no “s”.
- Pronoun possessives such as “its” (as in “its speed”) and “hers” do not require an apostrophe.
- Contractions such as “it’s” (as in “it is blue”) and “can’t” require an apostrophe; but note that contractions should be avoided in technical writing.

Other than in the cases above, apostrophes are not required.

### Exclamations

- Avoid exclamation marks! Never use more than one!!
- The proper place for an exclamation mark is after an exclamation (such as “Oh!”— not a common expression in technical writing), or, rarely, after a genuine surprise.

### Hyphenation

- There are three different “dash” symbols:
  - the hyphen “-” used for joining words,
  - the minus sign or
  - en-dash “–” used in arithmetic and for ranges such as “pages 101–127”, and the em-dash “—” used for punctuation.

### Capitalization

XX

- Today, only proper names are capitalized, and even these can be in lowercase if the name is in common use;

#### Checklist - Capitalization

- Headings can be either minimally or maximally capitalized. In the former, words are capitalized as they would be in normal text, except that the word following a colon is capitalized.

- Be consistent in your style of capitalization. It is acceptable to use maximum capitalization for sections and minimum capitalization for subsections, but not the other way around.

### Parentheses

#### Checklist - Parentheses

- A sentence containing a statement in parentheses should be punctuated exactly as if the parenthetical statement was not there.
- Parenthetical remarks should be asides that the reader can ignore — important text should not be in parentheses.
- In particular, don’t introduce information in parentheses that is referred to later. The same rule applies to footnotes.
- If you think some text should be relegated to a footnote, perhaps it can be deleted.
- Overuse of parentheses looks crowded.
- Avoid having more than one parenthesized remark per paragraph, or more than a couple per page.
- Parentheses within parentheses are hard to read and look like typing errors. Get rid of them.

### Citations

- Citations should be punctuated as if they were parenthetical remarks.
- The cite should be close to the material it relates to — poor placement of cites can be ambiguous.

## Graphs, Figures, and Tables

- Well-chosen illustrations breathe life into a paper, giving the reader interesting visual elements to browse and highlighting the central results and ideas.
- A typical figure consists of visual matter such as a graph or diagram, or of textual matter such as a table, algorithm, or, less commonly, complex mathematics.
- Some information is best presented in a pictorial form, such as a graph or figure, to show trends and relationships. Other information is best as a table, to show regularities.

### Graphs

- Graphs are often the best way to present numerical results.

#### Checklist - Graphs

- Graphs should be simple, with no more than a few plotted lines and a minimum of clutter.
  - If the graph is being used to demonstrate variation in output values for a range of input values, the horizontal or x-axis should be used for the parameter being varied, or the input; the vertical or y-axis is for the function of the parameter, or the output.
  - Plotted lines of discrete data should always have points marked by distinctive marks such as circles, boxes, or triangles.
- Consider using greys, colours, or line thickness rather than dots and dashes to distinguish between lines.

- Colours are more eye-catching than are greys, but, in a graph, do not necessarily communicate better.
  - First, some journals do not print in colour.
  - Second, colours can render inconsistently in different media;
  - Third, greys are emotionally neutral, and thus don’t carry the subconscious messages that colours can.

- Minimize use of unnecessary elements and remove all decoration.
  - Are the secondary ticks on the axes useful? If not, discard them.
  - Is a legend necessary? If not, remove it, and label the lines directly.
  - Do the captions have to be in a large font? If not, diminish them.
  - Are the fonts and font sizes different to those of the rest of the paper? If so, change them.
  - Axes should be inconspicuous; ink should be used for data, not dressing.
  - Gridlines and boxing are other forms of unnecessary ornamentation.
  - Secondary marks, such as axis ticks, should be a little lighter than the other elements.
  - The lines and other elements should be of similar weight — don’t mix a large, bold font with lightly drawn lines, for example.

- Graph-drawing tools allow bar graphs to be three dimensional, but the addition of depth is deceptive; if one bar is twice the height of another, the depth exaggerates the difference.

### Diagrams

- Diagrams serve many purposes in computing papers. They illustrate processes or architectures, explain data structures and algorithms, present relationships, visualize data, and show examples of interfaces.

- To design a diagram that is to be created with a manual tool, the first step is often to do initial sketches by hand, on paper. This early stage is the appropriate time to balance the diagram, by checking that it is well-proportioned, makes good use of the space, is laid out well and doesn’t have the elements bunched to one side, and is arranged so that the relative sizes of the elements look reasonable.

#### Checklist - Diagrams

- However, never submit a paper with a hand-drawn diagram unless it has been prepared by a professional; almost any diagram can be drawn well with the tools available for a typical computer.

- Illustrations are covered by copyright; figures from another source can only be re-used with permission of the author and the publisher of the original. If you wish to re-use a figure, get permission to do so and identify the original author and source, preferably in the caption.

### Tables

- Tables are used for presentation of information that is unsuitable for graphs or figures, such as the properties of each of a series of datasets or data where the exact values are important.

- A well-designed table has a logical hierarchical structure.
  - Simple tables are an arrangement of columns and rows, in which each column has a heading at the top and each row has a label or stub at the left.
  - In more complex tables, columns and rows may be partitioned or have internal structure.
  - The hierarchy can be indicated in several ways: rows or columns can be separated by double lines, single lines, or white space; headings can span several columns; labels can refer to several rows.
  - Deeper structure—which is sometimes necessary but is usually unwise—can be indicated by markup within the table such as embedded headings.

#### Checklist - Tables

- In most tables no position should be blank; if there is no applicable value, put in a dash, and explain somewhere what it means.
- Values of the same units in a column should be aligned in a logical way.
- Numbers should be aligned on the decimal point.

### Captions and Labels

- Captions and labels should be informative. Though it is common for captions to be only a few words, it is preferable for captions to fully describe the figure’s major elements.
- Full captions assist the reader who is skimming the paper or referring back to earlier figures and tables.
- Since figures and tables should be fairly self-contained, the caption is an appropriate place to explain important details, especially since these would otherwise interrupt the flow of the main text. The caption can also be used to expand abbreviations or notation used in headings.

#### Checklist - Captions and Labels

- Use either minimum or maximum capitalization, but minimum is better, particularly if the caption is a description rather than a label.
- Use italics for the caption so that it is distinct from other text.
- The caption is usually placed below a figure, but above a table.
- Each figure and table should be numbered to allow easy reference. If your word processor does not provide automatic numbering, you must number the figures yourself.
- A figure is usually at the top or the bottom of a page, or on a page by itself, to set it apart from ordinary text.
- A figure or table should always be introduced and discussed in the main text, preferably just before or on the page on which it occurs.

### Axes, Labels, and Headings

- The space constraints on axes, labels, and headings may mean that some terms have to be abbreviated; Where appropriate, units should be stated in labels. Write “Size (bytes)”, not just “Size”.
