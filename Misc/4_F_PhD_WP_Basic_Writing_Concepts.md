# Appendix 1: Basic Writing Concepts

Basic writing concepts: parts of speech and elementary sentence structure. These concepts are described with examples below.

## Parts of Speech

Parts of speech describe the roles words play in sentences.

### Nouns

Nouns name persons, places, things, or ideas, and they act as subjects and objects in sentences. Concrete nouns that refer to tangible objects such as `vertebrates, genes, and DNA`; and abstract nouns that refer to intangible ideas, emotions, or qualities such as `understanding, interpretation, and prediction`. Nouns are often introduced by articles: `a, an, or the`.

```text
Scientists have studied the arms of spiral galaxies.
```

The nouns in this example are all concrete: scientists, arms, and galaxies. Arms is introduced by the article the.

### Pronouns

Pronouns substitute for nouns. Some common pronouns are: `I, you, we, it, they, this, that, those, who, which, and what`.

```text
They have studied them to determine the origin of spiral structure.
```

The pronoun they substitutes for the noun scientists in the previous example, while the pronoun them substitutes for the noun arms.

### Adjectives

Adjectives describe or modify nouns or pronouns.

```text
Many scientists have studied the beautiful arms of spiral galaxies.
```

The adjective `many` modifies `scientists` , `beautiful` modifies `arms` , and `spiral` modifies `galaxies`.

### Verbs

Verbs show action or state of being.

```text
Many scientists have studied the beautiful arms of spiral galaxies.
```

The verb `have studied` describes the action.

### Verbals

Verbals look like verbs but function as adjectives, adverbs, or nouns.

```text
The beautiful arms of spiral galaxies, outlined by luminous young stars, have been the focus of many studies.
```

In this sentence, `have been` is the verb. `Outlined` is a verbal that comes from the verb `outline` , but it functions as an adjective modifying the noun `arms`.

### Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, or whole sentences. They limit or define those parts of speech by answering the questions `when ? how ? where ? how often ? and to what extent ?`

```text
We can identify the link between density wave acceleration of molecular clouds and the subsequent birth of stars most easily and unambiguously in galaxies external to our own.
```

The adverbs `easily` and `unambiguously` modify the verb `can identify` . Another adverb, `most` , modifies the adverb `easily`.

### Prepositions

Most prepositions show position in space and time. Examples are: `in , under , above , below , at , after, before, until , for , with , by , and on` . However, a few common prepositions do not, such as `of , as` , and `like` .

```text
Molecular clouds spend a large fraction of their time within the arms of spiral galaxies.
```

### Conjections

Conjunctions connect parts of sentences or entire sentences. Some common conjunctions are: `and , but , or , nor , for , yet , so , however , consequently , therefore , and because`.

```text
Many scientists have studied the beautiful arms of spiral galaxies outlined by luminous young stars, but the origin of spiral structure and the trigger for star formation remains unclear.
```

## Sentence Structure

Sentence structure refers to the way sentences are formed from words, phrases, and clauses.

### Verb

The main action word in a sentence is the `verb` , and a good way to start deciphering sentence structure is by finding it.

```text
Many shorebirds deplete the prey.
```

The verb is `deplete`, and it describes the action.

### Subject

The subject is what you write your sentence `about` . Asking “who?” or “what?” in front of the verb, usually gives you the subject.

```text
Many shorebirds deplete the prey.
```

The verb is `deplete`. Who or what depletes? The answer is `shorebirds` , the subject.

### Object

A sentence may or may not have an `object` — a noun that `receives` the action of the verb. In most cases, asking “who?” or “what?” after the verb gives you the object (circled below)(prey).

```text
Many shorebirds deplete the prey.
```

Many shorebirds deplete what? The answer is `prey`, the object.

In the following example, the sentence has no object.

```text
The shorebirds flew.
```

### Clause

A clause is a group of words with a subject and a verb. There are two kinds of clauses: independent and dependent. Two or more clauses often make up a single sentence.

#### Independent Clause

An independent clause has both subject and verb and can stand alone because it makes a complete statement. The simplest sentence is an independent clause.

```text
When shorebirds deplete the prey in a small area, the flock must move to a fresh site.
```

The independent clause is the part of the sentence that can stand alone, `the flock must move to a fresh site`. It contains the verb `must move` and the subject `flock` and makes a complete statement.

#### Dependent Clause

A dependent clause has both subject and verb but cannot stand alone; it `depends` on an independent clause to make a complete statement.

```text
When shorebirds deplete the prey in a small area , the flock must move to a fresh site.
```

The dependent clause is `When shorebirds deplete the prey in a small area`.

Because the clause begins with the dependent word `when`, it does not make a complete statement and cannot stand alone even though it contains the verb `deplete` and the subject shorebirds.

Here is a list of the common words that begin dependent clauses:

```text
after               since           whereas
although            so that         wherever
as                  than            whether
because             though          whichever
as if               that            which
before              unless          while
even if             until           who
even though         what            whom
ever since          whatever        whose
how                 when            why
if                  whenever        where
```

### Phrases

Phrases are groups of related words without subjects and verbs. They can function in sentences as subjects, modifiers, or objects.

#### Verbal Phrase

A verbal phrase consists of a verbal and the words associated with it, shown in brackets in the following sentence.

```text
Many shorebirds (feeding in a small area) deplete the prey.
```

The verbal phrase, `feeding in a small area` , functions as an adjective describing the shorebirds. `Feeding` is the verbal followed by the prepositional phrase `in a small area`.

#### Prepositional Phrase

A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition, an object, and any modifiers, shown in parentheses in the sentence below.

```text
Many shorebirds (in a small area) deplete the prey.
```

The prepositional phrase, `in a small area` , describes the shorebirds’ position. `In` is the preposition, `area` is the object of the preposition, and `small` modifies `area`.
