# Writing Paper - Outline

- A good outline for the paper is also a good plan for the research program.
- In the outline,
  - Do not write any significant amount of text, but get all the data in their proper place.
  - Any text should simply indicate what will go in that section.
- The key to efficient use of your and your's supervisor time is that start exchanging outlines and proposals as early in a project as possible.

## Reason for Outlines

- An outline is a written plan of the organization of a paper, including the data on which it rests.
  - Think of an outline as a carefully organized and presented set of data, with attendant objectives, hypotheses, and conclusions, rather than an outline of text.
  - An outline itself contains little text.

- If you and your supervisor
  - can agree on the details of the outline (that is, on the data and organization), the supporting text can be assembled fairly easily.
  - do not agree on the outline, any text is useless.

- Much of the time in writing a paper goes into the text; most of the thought goes into the organization of the data and into the analysis.
- It can be relatively efficient in time to go through several (even many) cycles of an outline before beginning to write text; writing many versions of the full text of a paper is slow.

## How to construct an Outline

Five simple steps:

### Step 1

- Start with a blank piece of paper, and write down, in any order, all important ideas that occur to you concerning the paper.
- Ask yourself the obvious questions:
  - Why did I do this work?
  - What does it mean?
  - What hypotheses did I mean to test?
  - What ones did I actually test?
  - What were the results?
  - Did the work yield a new method of compound? What?
  - What measurements did I make?
  - What compounds? How were they characterized?
- Sketch possible equations, figures, and schemes.
- It is essential to try to get the major ideas.

### Step 2

- When you have written down what you can, start with another piece of paper and try to organize the jumble of the first one.

- Introduction
  - Why did I do the work?
  - What were the central motivations and hypotheses?
  
- Results and Discussion
  - What were the results?
  - How were compounds made and characterized?
  - What was measured?

- Conclusions
  - What does it all mean?
  - What hypotheses were proved or disproved?
  - What did I learn?
  - Why does it make a difference?

### Step 3

- Take each of these sections, and organize it on yet finer scale.
- Concentrate on organizing the data.
- Construct figures, tables, and schemes to present the data as clearly and compactly as possible.

### Step 4

- Finally, put everything outline of sections, tables, sketches of figures, equations in good order.

### Step 5

- When you are satisfied that you have included all the data, and have a plausible organization, give the outline to your supervisor.
- Your supervisor will take this outline, add their opinions, suggest changes, and return it to you.
  - It usually takes four to five iterations (often with additional experiments) to agree on an outline.
  - When both have agreed, the data are usually in (or close to) final form (that is, the tables, figures, etc., in the outline will be the tables, figures,... in the paper).

## The Outline

Outline should contain:

### Title

### Authors

### Abstract

- Do not write an abstract. That can be done when the paper is complete.

### Introduction

- The first paragraph or two should be written out completely.
- Pay particular attention to the opening sentence.
- Ideally, it should state concisely the objective of the work, and indicate why this objective is important.

Introduction should have these elements:

#### Objectives

- Objectives of the work.
- The justification for these objectives:
  - Why is the work important?

#### Background

- Who else has done what? How? What have we done previously?

#### Guidance to the reader

- What should the reader watch for in the paper?
- What are the interesting high points?
- What strategy did we use?

#### Summary/conclusion

- What should the reader expect as conclusion?

#### Advanced Version

- In advanced versions of the outline,

  - you should also include all the sections that will go in the Experimental section (at the level of paragraph subheadings) and
  - indicate what information will go in the Microfilm section.

### Results and Discussions

- The results and discussion are usually combined.
- The separate parts should have subheadings in boldface to make this organization clear, and to help the reader scan through the final text to find the parts of interest.

### Conclusions

- In the outline, summarize the conclusions of the paper as a list of short phrases or sentences.
- Do not repeat what is in the Results section, unless special emphasis is needed.
- The Con- clusions section should be just that, and not a summary.
- It should add a new, higher level of analysis, and should indicate explicitly the significance of the work

### Experimental

- Include, in the correct order to correspond to the order in the Results section, all of the paragraph subheadings of the Experimental section.

### Summary

- Think of a paper as a collection of experimental results, summarized as clearly and economically as possible in figures, tables, equations, and schemes The text in the paper serves just to explain the data, and is secondary.
- The more information can be compressed into tables, equations, etc., the shorter and more readable the paper will be.

- Start writing possible outlines for papers early in a project. Do not wait until the end. The end may never come.
- Organize the outline and the paper around easily assimilated data, tables, equations, figures, schemes, rather than around text.
- Organize the result in order of importance, not in chronological order.
  - Start with the most important results, and put the secondary results later, if at all.
  - The reader usually does not care how you arrived at your big results, only what they are.
- Shorter papers are easier to read than longer ones.
