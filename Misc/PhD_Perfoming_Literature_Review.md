## Research Literature

Reading achieves several aims such as establishing your work is indeed novel or innovative; it helps you to understand current theory, discoveries, debates. It can identify new lines ofquestioning or investigation; and it should provide alternative perspectives on your work. This reading will ultimately be summarized in the background sections and the discussions of related work in your write-ups.

### Finding research papers

1. Explore [Scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com)
2. Visit the websites of research groups and researchers working in the area.
3. Explore important conferences to your area and search [DBLP Computer Science Bibliography](https://dblp.org/) for papers in that particular conference.
4. Explore the references in the paper X, who cited that paper X via [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/).
5. Keep searching and reading as separate activities.

### Critical Reading

Read papers by asking critical questions of them, such as:

- Is there a contribution? Is it significant?
- Is the contribution of interest?
- Are the results correct?
- Is the appropriate literature discussed?
- Does the methodology actually answer the initial question?
- Are the proposals and results critically analyzed?
- Are appropriate conclusions drawn from the results, or are there other possible interpretations?
- Are all the technical details correct? Are they sensible?
- Could the results be verified?
- Are there any serious ambiguities or inconsistencies?

The above questions also provide a hint on how a reserach paper should be written and should contain.

### Literature Review

A literature review is a structured analysis of a body of literature, and may cover work from several separate areas of research.

Rather, the papers should be grouped by topic, and critically discussed in a way that allows the reader to understand their contribution to the field, their limitations, and the questions that they leave open.

Begin a rough literature review as soon as you start reading, and, when you read a paper that you think will need to be discussed, add it in. Briefly summarize each paperâ€™s contribution and the evidence used to support the claims, and also note any shortcomings or features that are of interest. For your own reference, how the work might have been done better: for example, are there obvious experiments that should have been tried, or plausible counter-arguments to the claims?

Keep in mind that your understanding of other work helps examiners to judge your abilities as a researcher.
