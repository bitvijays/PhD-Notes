# Read Research Papers

## Critical Reading

Read papers by asking critical questions of them, such as:

- Is there a contribution? Is it significant?
- Is the contribution of interest?
- Are the results correct?
- Is the appropriate literature discussed?
- Does the methodology actually answer the initial question?
- Are the proposals and results critically analyzed?
- Are appropriate conclusions drawn from the results, or are there other possible interpretations?
- Are all the technical details correct? Are they sensible?
- Could the results be verified?
- Are there any serious ambiguities or inconsistencies?

The above questions also provide a hint on how a research paper should be written and should contain.

## Three pass approach

Read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plowing your way to the end.

- The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper.
- The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details.
- The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

### First Pass

The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird’s-eye view of
the paper.

#### Steps - FP

It consists of the following steps:

1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else.
3. Read the conclusions.
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read.

#### Output - FP

At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer the five Cs:

1. Category: What type of paper is this?
   - A measurement paper?
   - An analysis of an existing system?
   - A description of a research prototype?
2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. Contributions: What are the paper’s main contributions?
5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

#### Time Required - FP

Should take about five to ten minutes.

### The second pass

In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs.

#### Steps - SP

1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs. Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically sig- nificant? Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.
2. Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).

#### Output - SP

Should be able to grasp the content of the paper. You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else.

#### Time Required - SP

Should take up to an hour.

### Third Pass

To fully understand a paper, particularly if you are reviewer, requires a third pass.

#### Steps - TP

The key to the third pass is to

- attempt to virtually re-implement the paper: that is, making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work. By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper, you can easily identify not only a paper’s innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions. This pass requires great attention to detail.
- identify and challenge every assumption in every statement. Moreover, you should think about how you yourself would present a particular idea. This comparison of the actual with the virtual lends a sharp insight into the proof and presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely add this to your repertoire of tools.
- During this pass, you should also jot down ideas for future work.

#### Output - TP

- Should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points.
- Should be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques.

#### Time Required - TP

Should take four or five hours for beginners and about an hour for an experienced reader.
