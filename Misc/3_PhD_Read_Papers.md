# Read Research Papers

- Reading is the process of getting ideas from the author, you must focus on the author's thoughts, not just read the words on the paper.
- In order to get the most from your reading, you should be properly prepared.
- Find a quiet place to work where you will not be disturbed or distracted have a pencil and notepad at hand, and bear in mind exactly what you expect to get from this paper.

The below is an advice to a teacher for their student. We are the student here, so kind of understand what we should know:

- Don't just teach your students to read.
  - Teach them to question what they read, what they study.
  - Teach them to doubt.
  - Teach them to think.
  - Teach them to make mistakes and learn from them.
  - Teach them how to understand something.
  - Teach them how to teach others.
  - Teach them to summarise what they have learnt.
  - Let them find applications in "the real world" (esp. everyday items) themselves.

  As a student (we), should question, doubt, think, make mistakes, understand, teach others, summarize and find real world examples. Keeping this in mind while reading.

## Three pass approach

Read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plowing your way to the end.

- The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper.
- The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details.
- The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

### First Pass

The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird’s-eye view of the paper.

#### Steps - FP

It consists of the following steps:

1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else.
3. Read the conclusions.
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read.

#### Output - FP

At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer the five Cs:

1. Category: What type of paper is this?
   - A measurement paper?
   - An analysis of an existing system?
   - A description of a research prototype?
2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. Contributions: What are the paper’s main contributions?
5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

#### Time Required - FP

Should take about five to ten minutes.

### The second pass

In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs.

#### Steps - SP

- Look carefully at the figures, diagrams, graphs and other illustrations in the paper. Read the captions.
  - Are the axes properly labeled?
  - Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant?
  - Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.

- Read the definitions and theorems.

- Skim the bibliography.
  - How extensive is it?
  - Are the authors aware of current work?
  - Does it reference classic papers in this field?
  - Have you read any of the papers that are referred to?
  - Do you know relevant research that isn't cited?
  - Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).

- Consider the credibility of the article
  - Who wrote it? Are they well-known?
  - Where do they work? What biases might they have as a result of their employer?
  - Where was the article published? What is the reputation of the journal? Was the journal refereed?
  - When was it written? Might it be outdated or superceded?

#### Output - SP

Should be able to grasp the content of the paper. You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else.

#### Time Required - SP

Should take up to an hour.

### Third Pass

- To fully understand a paper, particularly if you are reviewer, requires a third pass.
- This pass requires great attention to detail.
- When you read a paper in detail, approach it with scientific skepticism. You can do this by trying to tear the arguments apart.
- By challenging what you read,
  - you will understand better what the author is saying and why they say it.
  - You will also be able to decide whether the evidence supports their conclusions, and to draw your own conclusions from their data.
  - Once you understand the paper, ask yourself how you can apply their approach to your own work.

#### Steps - TP

The key to the third pass is to

- During this pass, you should also jot down ideas for future work.

- Examine the assumptions
  - Do their results rely on any assumptions about trends or environments?
  - Are these assumptions reasonable?

- Examine the methods
  - Did they measure what they claim?
  - Can they explain what they observed?
  - Did they have adequate controls?
  - Were tests carried out in a standard way?

- Examine the statistics
  - Were appropriate statistical tests applied properly?
  - Did they do proper error analysis?
  - Are the results statistically significant?

- Examine the conclusions
  - Do the conclusions follow logically from the observations
  - What other explanations are there for the observed effects?
  - What other conclusions or correlations are there in the data that they did not point out?

- identify and challenge every assumption in every statement.
  - Moreover, you should think about how you yourself would present a particular idea.
  - This comparison of the actual with the virtual lends a sharp insight into the proof and presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely add this to your repertoire of tools.
- attempt to virtually re-implement the paper: that is, making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work.
  - By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper, you can easily identify not only a paper’s innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions.

#### Output - TP

- Should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points.
- Should be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques.

#### Time Required - TP

Should take four or five hours for beginners and about an hour for an experienced reader.

## Critical Reading

Read papers by asking critical questions of them, such as:

- Is there a contribution? Is it significant?
- Is the contribution of interest?
- Are the results correct?
- Is the appropriate literature discussed?
- Does the methodology actually answer the initial question?
- Are the proposals and results critically analyzed?
- Are appropriate conclusions drawn from the results, or are there other possible interpretations?
- Are all the technical details correct? Are they sensible?
- Could the results be verified?
- Are there any serious ambiguities or inconsistencies?

The above questions also provide a hint on how a research paper should be written and should contain.
