## Writing up a paper

### Writing Paper

write a paper, you can expect most
reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

A good principle is to begin early: if it is possible to start writing, then writing should start. Shaping the research and its outcomes into a write-up is an effective way of giving structure to a project.

The three main phases of a write-up are organizing materials so that the work tells a story, giving this story the structure of a thesis or ofan academic paper, and actually writing.

### The Scope of a Paper

First task is to describe your aims. An effective exercise is to write down everything that motivated you to start the research. What did you want to achieve? What problems did you expect to address? What makes the problems interesting? Next, define the scope of the work that you plan to write up. It is necessary to make choices about what to include, and thus it is necessary to identify what might be included.

what the core contribution of thework is going to be.

Which results are the most surprising? • What is the one result that other researchers might adopt in their work? • Are the other outcomes independent enough to be published separately later on? Are they interesting enough to justify their being included?
• Does it make sense to explain the new algorithms first, followed by description of the previous algorithms in terms of how they differ from the new work? Or is the contribution of the new work more obvious if the old approaches are described first, to set the context?
• What assumptions or definitions need to be formalized before the main theorem can be presented?
• What is the key background work that has to be discussed? • Who is the readership? For example, are you writing for specialists in your area, your examiners, or a general computer science audience?

A valuable exercise at this stage is to speculate on the format and scope of the
results. Early in the investigation, decisions will have beenmade about howthe results are tobe evaluated—that is, about whichmeasures are tobeused todetermine whether the research has succeeded or failed.

You may be reporting a particular piece of work, but the way it is reported is determined by the characteristics of the audience


Another element in the process of developing a paper is deciding where the work
might be published. 

In particular, the venue partly determines the scope of a paper. For example, is there a page limit? Are there specific conventions to be observed? Are the other papers in that venue primarily theoretical or experimental? What prior knowledge or background is a reader likely to have? Do the editors require that your code be available online?

Once the material for a paper has been collected it has to be organized into a
coherent self-contained narrative, which ultimately will form the body of the write- up. Turning this narrative into awrite-up involves putting it in the form ofan academic paper: including an introduction, a bibliography, and so on.

### Telling a story

A cornerstone of good writing is identifying what the reader needs to learn. A strong thesis or paper has a story-like flow, with a sequence of concepts building from a foundation of knowledge assumed to be common to all readers up to new ideas and results. Thus an effective paper educates its readers. It leads readers from what they already know to new knowledge you want them to learn. For this reason, the body of a good paper—everything between the introduction and the conclusions—should have a logical flow that has the feel of a narrative.


The early parts of the paper’s body typically explain hypotheses or claims; the reader expects to discover by the end whether these are justified.

There are several common ways for structuring the body of a paper, including as
a chain, by specificity, by example, and by complexity

, a chain in which the results and the back- ground on which they build dictate a logical order for presentation of the material. First might come, say, a problem statement, then a review of previous solutions and their drawbacks, then the new solution, and finally a demonstration that the solution improves on its predecessors.

One option is to
structure by specificity, an approach that is particularly appropriate for results that can be divided into several stages. The material is first outlined in general terms, then the details are progressively filled in.

Another structure is by example, in which the idea or result is initially explained
by, say, applying it to some typical problem. Then the idea can be explained more formally, in a framework the example has made concrete and familiar.

A final alternative is to structure the body by complexity. For example, a simple
case can be given first, then a more complex case can be explained as an extension, thus avoiding the difficulty of explaining foundational concepts in a complex frame- work. This approach is a kind of tutorial: the reader is brought by small steps to the full result.

### Organisation

Scientific papers follow a standard structure that allows readers to quickly dis- cover the main results, and then, if interested, to examine the supporting evidence.
A well-structured write-up accommodates this behaviour by having important statements as near the beginning as possible.

Describe the work in the context of accepted scientific knowledge. • State the idea that is being investigated, often as a theory or hypothesis. • Explain what is new about the idea, what is being evaluated, or what contribution the paper is making.
• Justify the theory, by methods such as proof or experiment.

A typical write-up has most of the following components

#### Title and Author

Papers begin with their title and information about authors including name, affiliation, and address.

The front matter of a paper may also include other elements. One is acknowl- edgements, as discussed in Chap.6, which alternatively may follow the conclusions. Another element is a collection ofsearch terms, keywords, or key phrases—additional terminology that can be used to describe the topic of the paper.

#### Abstract

An abstract is typically a single paragraph of about 50–200 words. concise summary of the paper’s aims, scope, and conclusions. Irrelevancies, such as minor details or a description of the structure of the paper, are usually inappropriate, as are acronyms, mathematics, abbreviations, or citations

Many abstracts follow a five-element organization:

1. A general statement introducing the broad research area of the particular topic being investigated.
2. An explanation of the specific problem (difficulty, obstacle, challenge) to be solved.
3. A review of existing or standard solutions to this problem and their limitations. 4. An outline of the proposed new solution. 5. A summary of how the solution was evaluated and what the outcomes of the evaluation were.

a draft of an abstract can consist of five sentences, one for each of the points above. Introductions should be structured in much the sameway, but with a paragraph or two, not a sentence, for each component.

#### Introduction

An introduction can be regarded as an expanded version of the abstract. It should describe the paper’s topic, the problem being studied, references to key papers, the approach to the solution, the scope and limitations of the solution, and the outcomes.

It should include motivation: the introduction should explain why
he problem is interesting, what the relevant scientific issues are, why the approach taken is a good one, and why the outcomes are significant. That is, the introduction should show that the paper is worth reading and it should
allow the reader to understand your perspective, so that the reader and you can proceed on a basis of common understanding. The introduction can discuss the importance or ramifications of the conclusions
but should include only a brief summary of the supporting evidence, which the interested reader can find in the body of the paper.

The reader should also understand the contribution, that is, what the discovery
of the work is—the core idea that the referees or examiners need to appreciate as novel and important. This understanding requires that the reader appreciates what the properties of this contribution are, what makes it interesting and plausible, what method was used to investigate it, and why the method is appropriate


#### Body

The body of a paper should present the results. This presentation should provide necessary background and terminology, explain the chain of reasoning that leads to the conclusions, provide the details of central proofs, summarize any experimental outcomes, and state in detail the conclusions outlined in the introduction.

Since the body can be long, narrative flow and a clear logical structure are essential

#### Conclusions

The conclusions section, or summary, is used to draw together the topics discussed in the paper. This section should include a concise statement of the paper’s important results and an explanation of their significance. This is an appropriate place to state (or restate) any limitations of the work: shortcomings in the experiments, problems that the theory does not address, and so on. The conclusions are an appropriate place to look beyond the current context to
other problems that were not addressed, to questions that were not answered, to variations that could be explored. They may include speculation, such as discussion of possible consequences of the results. A conclusion is that which concludes, or the end. Conclusions are the inferences
drawn from a collection of information. Write “Conclusions”, not “Conclusion”. If you have no conclusions to draw, write “Summary”, which is often the appropriate way to end a thesis chapter.


#### Bibliography

A paper’s bibliography, or its set of references, is a complete list of theses, papers, books, and reports cited in the text. No other items should be included.

#### Appendices

Some papers have appendices giving detail of proofs or experimental results, and, where appropriate,material such as listings ofcomputer programs. Appendices are only occasionally necessary for a paper, in cases where there is
material such as a proof whose length would interrupt the flow.
