# Summary

## Starting Your PhD

### Scientific Publications

Scientific publications can be of different types:

1. Book
2. Thesis
3. Journal Article: Typically an end product of the research process,
4. A Paper or extended abstract (detail of work is omitted) in a conference or workshop proceedings, or a manuscript: Can be an end-product, but mostly work in progress.

### Starting a research

1. Formation of a precise question aka the aim of the research.
2. Development of a detailed understanding: Literature Review/ Related work - reading and critical analysis of scientific literature and other resources.
3. Gathering of evidence related to the question, through experiment, analysis, or theory. These are intended to support—or disprove—the hypothesis underlying the question.
4. Linking of the question and evidence with an argument, that is, a chain of reasoning.
5. Description of the work in a publication.

Experienced scientists aiming to write a paper on a reserach subject tend to be fairly focused: they quickly design a series of experiments or theoretical goals, investigate the relevant literature, and set deadlines.

Larger research program such as a Ph.D., there are

- short-term goals: Include the current specific explorations, which may be intended to lead to an initial research paper; short-term research goals gives shape to a research program.
- long-term goals: are the wider investigation that will eventually form the basis of the student’s thesis.

Typical research project has just one deadline: completion! There might be few administrative requirements such as submission of a project outline or a progress report, but many students (and advisors) do not take these milestones seriously.

PhD Thesis is the only part which is assessed. It is a mistake, for example, to implement a complete system rather than ask what code is needed to explore the research questions.
explicitly consider what is needed at the end, then reason backwards. The final thing required is the write-up in the form of a thesis, paper, or report; so you need to plan in terms of the steps necessary to produce the write-up. the write-up is likely to involve a background review, explanations ofprevious and newalgorithms, descriptions of experiments, and analysis of outcomes. Completion of each of these elements is a milestone.

### Charactertics shared by sucessful reserach students

1. show a willingness to read widely, to explore the field broadly beyond their specific topic, to try things out, and to generally take part in the academic community.
2. have the enthusiasm to develop their interest in some area, and then ask for advice on how that interest can be turned into a thesis project.
3. have the ability and persistence to undertake a detailed (and even gruelling) investigation of a specific facet of a larger topic
4. take the initiative in terms of what needs to be done and how to present it, and gradually assume responsibility for all aspects of the research
5. systematic and organized, and understand the need for rigour, discipline, stringency, quality, and high standards.
6. they actively reflect on habits and working practices, and seek to improve themselves and overcome their limitations and knowledge gaps.
7. work looks plausible; it has the form and feel of high-quality published papers
8. Have the strength to keep working despite some significant failed or unsuccessful activity; in a Ph.D., loss of months of work is not unusual.
9. Note that neither “brilliance” nor “genius” is in this list.

### Getting Started Checklist

- Is your proposed topic clearly a research activity? Is it consistent with the aims and purposes of research?
- How is your project different from, say, software development, essay writing, or data analysis?
- In the context of your project, what are the area, topic, and research question? (How are these concepts distinct from each other?)
- Is the project of appropriate scale, with challenges that are a match to your skills and interests? Is the question narrowenough to give you confidence that the project is achievable?
- Is the project distinct from other active projects in your research group? Is it clear that the anticipated outcomes are interesting enough to justify the work?
- Is it clear what skills and contributions you bring to the project, and what will be contributed by your advisor? What skills do you need to develop?
- What resources are required and how will you obtain them? • What are the likely obstacles to completion, or the greatest difficulties? Do you know how these will be addressed?
- Can you write down a road map, with milestones, that provides a clear path to the anticipated research outcomes?
- Do you and your advisor have an agreed method for working together, with a defined schedule of meetings?

## Research Literature

Reading achieves several aims such as establishing your work is indeed novel or innovative; it helps you to understand current theory, discoveries, debates. It can identify new lines ofquestioning or investigation; and it should provide alternative perspectives on your work. This reading will ultimately be summarized in the background sections and the discussions of related work in your write-ups.

### Finding research papers

1. Explore [Scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com)
2. Visit the websites of research groups and researchers working in the area.
3. Explore important conferences to your area and search [DBLP Computer Science Bibliography](https://dblp.org/) for papers in that particular conference.
4. Explore the references in the paper X, who cited that paper X via [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/).
5. Keep searching and reading as separate activities.

### Critical Reading

Read papers by asking critical questions of them, such as:

- Is there a contribution? Is it significant?
- Is the contribution of interest?
- Are the results correct?
- Is the appropriate literature discussed?
- Does the methodology actually answer the initial question?
- Are the proposals and results critically analyzed?
- Are appropriate conclusions drawn from the results, or are there other possible interpretations?
- Are all the technical details correct? Are they sensible?
- Could the results be verified?
- Are there any serious ambiguities or inconsistencies?

The above questions also provide a hint on how a reserach paper should be written and should contain.

### Literature Review

A literature review is a structured analysis of a body of literature, and may cover work from several separate areas of research.

Rather, the papers should be grouped by topic, and critically discussed in a way that allows the reader to understand their contribution to the field, their limitations, and the questions that they leave open.

Begin a rough literature review as soon as you start reading, and, when you read a paper that you think will need to be discussed, add it in. Briefly summarize each paper’s contribution and the evidence used to support the claims, and also note any shortcomings or features that are of interest. For your own reference, how the work might have been done better: for example, are there obvious experiments that should have been tried, or plausible counter-arguments to the claims?

Keep in mind that your understanding of other work helps examiners to judge your abilities as a researcher.

## Reviewing Papers

### Contribution

Contribution is the main criterion for judging a paper. A paper is a contribution if it has two properties: originality and validity. The originality of a paper is the degree to which the ideas presented are significant, new, and interesting. Most papers are to some degree extensions or variations of previously published work; really groundbreaking ideas are rare.

### Evaluation of Papers

• Is the contribution timely or only of historical interest?
• Is the topic relevant to the venue’s typical readership?
• What is missing? What would complete the presentation? Is any of the material unnecessary?
• How broad is the likely readership?
• Can the paper be understood? Is it clearly written? Is the presentation at an adequate standard?
• Does the content justify the length?

Most papers have an explicit or implicit hypothesis—some assertion that is claimed to be true—and a proposal or innovation. Try to identify what the hypothesis is.
The quality of a paper can be reflected in its bibliography. For example, how many references are there?

### Checklist

When you recommend that a paper be accepted, you should:

- Convince yourself that it has no serious defects.
- Convince the editor that it is of an acceptable standard, by explaining why it is original, valid, and clear.
- List the changes, major and minor, that should be made before it appears in print, and where possible help the author by indicating not just what to change but what to change it to; but if there are excessive numbers of errors of some kind, you may instead want to give a few examples and recommend that the paper be proofread.
- Take reasonable care in checking details such as mathematics, formulas, and the bibliography.

When you recommend that a paper be rejected, or recommend that it be resubmitted after major changes, you should:

- Give a clear explanation of the faults and, where possible, discuss how they could be rectified.
- Indicate which parts of the work are of value and which should be discarded, that is, discuss what you believe the contribution to be.
- Check the paper to a reasonable level of detail, unless it is unusually sloppy or ill-thought.

In either case you should:

- Provide good references with which the authors should be familiar.
- Ask yourself whether your comments are fair, specific, and polite.
- Be honest about your limitations as a referee of that paper.
- Check your review as carefully as you would check one of your own papers prior to submission.

## Hypothesis, Questions and Evidence

The first stages of a research program involve choice of interesting topics or problems, and then identification of particular issues to investigate. The research is given direction by development of specific questions that the program aims to answer.

Questions are based on an understanding—an informal model, perhaps—of how something works, or interacts, or behaves. They establish a framework for making observations about the object being studied. This framework can be characterised as a statement of belief about how the object behaves—in other words, a hypothesis. Many hypotheses concern some aspect of the physical world: whether something is occurring, whether it is possible to alter something in a predictable way, or whether a model is able to accurately predict new events.

A hypothesis or research question should be specific and precise, and should be unambiguous; the more loosely a concept is defined, the more easily it will satisfy many needs simultaneously, even when these needs are contradictory.

A hypothesis must be testable.
A hypothesis should be capable of falsification.

### Defending Hypothesis

One component ofa strong paper is a precise, interesting hypothesis.Another component is the testing of the hypothesis and the presentation of the supporting evidence.

In presenting the hypothesis, you need to construct an argument relating your hypothesis to the evidence.

A paper can be viewed as an assembly of evidence and supporting explanations; that is, as an attempt to persuade others to share your conclusions.

There are, broadly speaking, four kinds of evidence that can be used to support a hypothesis:

- proof: An proof is a formal argument that a hypothesis is correct (or wrong).
- modelling: A model is a mathematical description of the hypothesis (or some compo-nent of the hypothesis, such as an algorithm whose properties are being considered) and there will usually be a demonstration that the hypothesis and model do indeedcorrespond.
- simulation: A simulation is usually an implementation or partial implementation of a simplified form of the hypothesis, in which the difficulties of a full implementation are sidestepped by omission or approximation.
- experiment: An experiment is a full test of the hypothesis, based on an
implementation of the proposal and on real—or highly realistic—data.

a paper must be persuasive. Your written work is the one chance
to persuade readers to accept the ideas, and they will only do so if the evidence and arguments are complete and convincing.

### Hypothesis, Questions and evidence checklist

Regarding hypotheses and questions,

- What phenomena or properties are being investigated? Why are they of interest? - Has the aim of the research been articulated? What are the specific hypotheses and research questions? Are these elements convincingly connected to each other?
- What are the underlying assumptions? Are they sensible?
- What would disprove the hypothesis? Does it have any improbable consequences? - To what extent is the work innovative? Is this reflected in the claims?
- Has the work been critically questioned? Have you satisfied yourself that it is sound science?

Regarding evidence and measurement,

- What forms of evidence are to be used? If it is a model or a simulation, what demonstrates that the results have practical validity?
- How is the evidence to be measured? Are the chosen methods of measurement objective, appropriate, and reasonable?
- What are the qualitative aims, and what makes the quantitative measures you have chosen appropriate to those aims?
- Will the outcomes be predictive?
- What compromises or simplifications are inherent in your choice of measure?
- What is the argument that will link the evidence to the hypothesis?
- To what extent will positive results persuasively confirm the hypothesis? Will negative results disprove it?
- What are the likely weaknesses of or limitations to your approach?

## Writing up a paper

A good principle is to begin early: if it is possible to start writing, then writing should start. Shaping the research and its outcomes into a write-up is an effective way of giving structure to a project.

The three main phases of a write-up are organizing materials so that the work tells a story, giving this story the structure of a thesis or ofan academic paper, and actually writing.

### The Scope of a Paper

First task is to describe your aims. An effective exercise is to write down everything that motivated you to start the research. What did you want to achieve? What problems did you expect to address? What makes the problems interesting? Next, define the scope of the work that you plan to write up. It is necessary to make choices about what to include, and thus it is necessary to identify what might be included.

what the core contribution of thework is going to be.

Which results are the most surprising? • What is the one result that other researchers might adopt in their work? • Are the other outcomes independent enough to be published separately later on? Are they interesting enough to justify their being included?
• Does it make sense to explain the new algorithms first, followed by description of the previous algorithms in terms of how they differ from the new work? Or is the contribution of the new work more obvious if the old approaches are described first, to set the context?
• What assumptions or definitions need to be formalized before the main theorem can be presented?
• What is the key background work that has to be discussed? • Who is the readership? For example, are you writing for specialists in your area, your examiners, or a general computer science audience?

A valuable exercise at this stage is to speculate on the format and scope of the
results. Early in the investigation, decisions will have beenmade about howthe results are tobe evaluated—that is, about whichmeasures are tobeused todetermine whether the research has succeeded or failed.

You may be reporting a particular piece of work, but the way it is reported is determined by the characteristics of the audience


Another element in the process of developing a paper is deciding where the work
might be published. 

In particular, the venue partly determines the scope of a paper. For example, is there a page limit? Are there specific conventions to be observed? Are the other papers in that venue primarily theoretical or experimental? What prior knowledge or background is a reader likely to have? Do the editors require that your code be available online?

Once the material for a paper has been collected it has to be organized into a
coherent self-contained narrative, which ultimately will form the body of the write- up. Turning this narrative into awrite-up involves putting it in the form ofan academic paper: including an introduction, a bibliography, and so on.

### Telling a story

A cornerstone of good writing is identifying what the reader needs to learn. A strong thesis or paper has a story-like flow, with a sequence of concepts building from a foundation of knowledge assumed to be common to all readers up to new ideas and results. Thus an effective paper educates its readers. It leads readers from what they already know to new knowledge you want them to learn. For this reason, the body of a good paper—everything between the introduction and the conclusions—should have a logical flow that has the feel of a narrative.


The early parts of the paper’s body typically explain hypotheses or claims; the reader expects to discover by the end whether these are justified.

There are several common ways for structuring the body of a paper, including as
a chain, by specificity, by example, and by complexity

, a chain in which the results and the back- ground on which they build dictate a logical order for presentation of the material. First might come, say, a problem statement, then a review of previous solutions and their drawbacks, then the new solution, and finally a demonstration that the solution improves on its predecessors.

One option is to
structure by specificity, an approach that is particularly appropriate for results that can be divided into several stages. The material is first outlined in general terms, then the details are progressively filled in.

Another structure is by example, in which the idea or result is initially explained
by, say, applying it to some typical problem. Then the idea can be explained more formally, in a framework the example has made concrete and familiar.

A final alternative is to structure the body by complexity. For example, a simple
case can be given first, then a more complex case can be explained as an extension, thus avoiding the difficulty of explaining foundational concepts in a complex frame- work. This approach is a kind of tutorial: the reader is brought by small steps to the full result.

### Organisation

Scientific papers follow a standard structure that allows readers to quickly dis- cover the main results, and then, if interested, to examine the supporting evidence.
A well-structured write-up accommodates this behaviour by having important statements as near the beginning as possible.

Describe the work in the context of accepted scientific knowledge. • State the idea that is being investigated, often as a theory or hypothesis. • Explain what is new about the idea, what is being evaluated, or what contribution the paper is making.
• Justify the theory, by methods such as proof or experiment.

A typical write-up has most of the following components

#### Title and Author

Papers begin with their title and information about authors including name, affiliation, and address.

The front matter of a paper may also include other elements. One is acknowl- edgements, as discussed in Chap.6, which alternatively may follow the conclusions. Another element is a collection ofsearch terms, keywords, or key phrases—additional terminology that can be used to describe the topic of the paper.

#### Abstract

An abstract is typically a single paragraph of about 50–200 words. concise summary of the paper’s aims, scope, and conclusions. Irrelevancies, such as minor details or a description of the structure of the paper, are usually inappropriate, as are acronyms, mathematics, abbreviations, or citations

Many abstracts follow a five-element organization:

1. A general statement introducing the broad research area of the particular topic being investigated.
2. An explanation of the specific problem (difficulty, obstacle, challenge) to be solved.
3. A review of existing or standard solutions to this problem and their limitations. 4. An outline of the proposed new solution. 5. A summary of how the solution was evaluated and what the outcomes of the evaluation were.

a draft of an abstract can consist of five sentences, one for each of the points above. Introductions should be structured in much the sameway, but with a paragraph or two, not a sentence, for each component.

#### Introduction

An introduction can be regarded as an expanded version of the abstract. It should describe the paper’s topic, the problem being studied, references to key papers, the approach to the solution, the scope and limitations of the solution, and the outcomes.

It should include motivation: the introduction should explain why
he problem is interesting, what the relevant scientific issues are, why the approach taken is a good one, and why the outcomes are significant. That is, the introduction should show that the paper is worth reading and it should
allow the reader to understand your perspective, so that the reader and you can proceed on a basis of common understanding. The introduction can discuss the importance or ramifications of the conclusions
but should include only a brief summary of the supporting evidence, which the interested reader can find in the body of the paper.

The reader should also understand the contribution, that is, what the discovery
of the work is—the core idea that the referees or examiners need to appreciate as novel and important. This understanding requires that the reader appreciates what the properties of this contribution are, what makes it interesting and plausible, what method was used to investigate it, and why the method is appropriate


#### Body

The body of a paper should present the results. This presentation should provide necessary background and terminology, explain the chain of reasoning that leads to the conclusions, provide the details of central proofs, summarize any experimental outcomes, and state in detail the conclusions outlined in the introduction.

Since the body can be long, narrative flow and a clear logical structure are essential

#### Conclusions

The conclusions section, or summary, is used to draw together the topics discussed in the paper. This section should include a concise statement of the paper’s important results and an explanation of their significance. This is an appropriate place to state (or restate) any limitations of the work: shortcomings in the experiments, problems that the theory does not address, and so on. The conclusions are an appropriate place to look beyond the current context to
other problems that were not addressed, to questions that were not answered, to variations that could be explored. They may include speculation, such as discussion of possible consequences of the results. A conclusion is that which concludes, or the end. Conclusions are the inferences
drawn from a collection of information. Write “Conclusions”, not “Conclusion”. If you have no conclusions to draw, write “Summary”, which is often the appropriate way to end a thesis chapter.


#### Bibliography

A paper’s bibliography, or its set of references, is a complete list of theses, papers, books, and reports cited in the text. No other items should be included.

#### Appendices

Some papers have appendices giving detail of proofs or experimental results, and, where appropriate,material such as listings ofcomputer programs. Appendices are only occasionally necessary for a paper, in cases where there is
material such as a proof whose length would interrupt the flow.

#### Co-authoring

The inclusion of several people as authors means that, in principle, all these people contributed in some significant way to the intellectual content of the paper. In many cases, it also means that the task of writing was shared.


In cases where researchers are working more or less as equals, one strategy is
to brainstorm the contents of the paper, then for each author to write a designated section

Another strategy—my preferred model for collaboration—is to take turns. One person writes a draft, the next revises and extends, and so on, with each person holding an exclusive lock on the paper while amending it.

#### Theses

A thesis (or dissertation) is how research students present their work for examination.

The questions that examiners respond to are much the same as those a referee
would ask of a paper.

A thesis passes (or fails) on the strength of your demonstration of competence; even if good results are not achieved, the thesis should pass if you have shown the ability to undertake high-quality research. Questions that examiners might be asked to address include whether you have demonstrated command of the fundamentals of the discipline, whether you have the ability to correctly interpret results, and whether you have sufficiently strong communication skills.

In a paper, the primary element is the contribution: whether the research is novel, interesting, and correct. In a thesis, the primary element is the competence: whether the student has demonstrated that they are capable of undertaking indepen- dent research.

### Writing Up Checklist

Regarding the scope ofthe work, • In what forum, or kind of forum, do you plan to publish? • Is the scope of the work well defined? • Is there a single, clearly articulated research question or goal? Have you identified which aspect of the work is of greatest impact, or of greatest interest?
• What would success in the project look like? What would failure look like? Can you anticipate the form of the outcomes in either case?


Who is the readership? How deep or thorough will the background need to be to ensure that the readers fully appreciate the work?
• Do you and your co-authors have an agreed methodology for sharing the work of completing the write-up?
• Are the roles of the participants clear? What are your responsibilities? What activ- ities will the others undertake?

Regarding how the write-up is organized and presented,
• What form will your write-up take? What other paper or thesis should your write- up resemble?
• Areyou writing to awell-defined structure and organization? What are the sections, and how do they relate to each other?
• Do the title, abstract, and introduction appropriately set the context for the work? • Have you identified a structure for the argument? A format for the results? • Have you established a connection between the question, background, methods, and results? That is, have you identified the shape that the narrative will take?
• Is there anything unusual about the organization of the write-up, and, if so, is there a reason for this organization and how will it be explained to the reader?
• If you are writing a paper, are you working to defined length limits or a specified format?
• If you are writing a thesis, are there formatting requirements? Regarding your approach to the work,
• Are you maintaining a log and notebook? • Do you work to an explicit schedule with dates and targets? • Do the deadlines leave enough time for your advisor to provide feedback on your drafts, or for your colleagues to contribute to the material?
• Do you have an effective approach to writing that lets you quickly generate text? • How are results being selected for presentation? How do these results relate to your original aims? How do the selected results relate to the complete body of evidence you are gathering?
• Have the results been critically analyzed? • In a thesis with multiple contributions, are they explicitly linked by an overarching goal?
• For a thesis, do you knowhow it will be examined? How is that knowledge shaping your writing.


## Good Style

### Economy

Text should be taut. The length ofa paper should reflect its content—it is admirable to use only as many words as are required. Every sentence should be necessary.

Taut writing is a consequence of careful, frequent revision. Aim to delete superflu-
ous words, simplify sentence structure, and establish a logical flow.

### Tone

Science writing should be objective and accurate. Many of the elements that give literature its strength—nuance, ambiguity, metaphor, sensuality—are inappropriate for technical work.

Simple writing follows from a few simple rules:
• Have one idea per sentence or paragraph and one topic per section. • Have a straightforward, logical organization. • Use short words. • Use short sentences with simple structure. • Keep paragraphs short. • Avoid buzzwords, clichés, and slang. • Avoid excess, in length or style. • Omit unnecessary material. • Be specific, not vague or abstract. • Break these rules if there is a good reason to do so.

Use direct statements and expressions involving “we” or “I”—that is, the active
voice—to make reading more pleasant and to help distinguish new results from old.

### Examples

Use an example whenever it adds clarification. A small example often means the difference between communication and confusion, particularly if the concept being illustrated is fundamental to understanding the paper. People learn by generalizing from concrete instances, and examples can give substance to abstract concepts.

### Motivation

The introduction usually gives some indication of the organization of the paper,
by outlining the results and their context, and may include a list of the parts of the paper, but these measures by themselves are not sufficient. Brief summaries at the start and end of each section are helpful, as are sentences connecting one section to the next;

Link text together as a narrative—each section should have a clear story to tell. The connection between one paragraph and the next should be obvious. This principle is sometimes expressed as: Tell the reader what you are going to say, then say it, and then tell the reader that you have said it

### Balance

Within a paper, each topic should be discussed to a similar depth.

### Voice

Avoid excessive use of indirect statements (passive voice), particularly descriptions of actions that don’t indicate who or what performs them. The direct style (active voice) is often less stilted and easier to read.


Another unpleasant indirect style is the artificial use of verbs like “perform” or
“utilize”, perhaps in the false belief that such writing is more precise or scientific.

Other words often used in this way include “achieved”, “carried out”, “conducted”, “done”, “occurred”, and “effected”.


Use of “we” is valuable when trying to distinguish between the contribution made
in your paper and existing results in a field, particularly in an abstract or introduction.

Use of “we” can allow some kinds of statements to be simplified—consider “we show” versus “in this paper it is shown that”. “We” is preferable to pretentious expressions such as “the authors”.

Some authors use phrases such as “this paper shows” and “this section argues”.
These phrases, with their implication that the paper, not the author, is doing the arguing, should generally be avoided

### The upper hand

### Obfuscation

In science writing, vague statements are regrettably common. It is always prefer-
able to be specific: exceptions are or are not possible, data was transmitted at a certain rate, and so on. Stating that “theremay be exceptions in some circumstances” or “data was transmitted fast” is not helpful.

Obfuscation can arise in other ways: exaggeration, omission of relevant information, or bold statements of conclusions based on flimsy evidence.

### Analogies

Analogies are curious things: what seems perfectly alike or parallel to one person may seem entirely unalike to another.

### Straw Men

A straw man is an indefensible hypothesis that an author describes for the sole purpose of criticizing it. A paraphrasing of an instance in a published paper is “it can be argued that databases do not require indexes”, in which the author and reader are well aware that a database without an index is as practical as a library without a catalogue.

Another form of strawman is the contrasting of a new idea with some impossibly
bad alternative, to put the new idea in a favourable light.

A more subtle form of straw man is comparison between the new and the ancient.

A strawman is an example of rhetoric—ofattempting towin an argument through presentation rather than reasoning. Other forms of rhetoric are appeal to authority, appeal to intuitively obvious truth, and presentation of received wisdom as fact.

If there is evidence—a study or proof, not someone else’s opinion—then cite it. Unsubstantiated claims should be clearly noted as such, not dressed up as accepted knowledge.

Avoid nonsense, absurdity, and over-generalization. Example:
Execution was almost instantaneous. The Web is infinitely large. There is no limit to the possible efficiency gains.

### Reference and Citations

Refer to an original paper in preference to a secondary source; to well-written material in preference to bad; to a book, conference paper, or journal article in preference to a workshop paper; to a workshop paper in preference to a manuscript (which have the disadvantage of being unrefereed); and to formally published documents rather than Web pages.

Avoid reference to private communications and information provided in forums such as seminars or talks—such information cannot be accessed or verified by the reader. In the rare circumstance that you must refer to such material, do so via a footnote, parenthetical remark, or acknowledgement.

On rare occasions it is necessary to refer to a result in an inaccessible paper.

Cited material often uses different terminology, spelling, or notation, or is written for an entirely different context. When you use results from other papers, be sure to show the relationship to your own work.

References that are discussed should not be anonymous.

```
X - Other work [16] has used an approach in which…
Y - Marsden [16] has used an approach in which…
```

Likewise, self-references should not be anonymous—it should be clear to the
reader that references used to support your argument are your own papers, not inde- pendent authorities.

One is the ordinal-number style, in
which entries in the reference list are numbered and are cited by their number, as in “…is discussed elsewhere [16]”. The other is the name-and-date or Harvard style— my preferred style—in which entries are cited by author name using either square or round brackets:

A third common style is to use superscripted ordinal numbers, as in “… is discussed elsewhere16”.

When discussing a reference with more than two authors, all but the first author’s
name can be replaced by “et al.” In a variant of this style, the full list is given at the first citation, and the abbreviated form thereafter. Note the stop: “et al.” is an abbreviation.

Journal articles. The journal name should be given in full, and author names, paper title, year, volume, number, and pages must be provided. Consider also giving the month. Thus:

Conference papers. The conference name should be complete, and authors, title, year, and pages must be provided. Information such as publisher, conference location, month, and editors should also be given.

Books. Give title, authors, publisher, year, and, where relevant, edition and volume. If the reference is to a specific part of the book, give page numbers; for example write “(Howing 1994; pp. 22–31)” rather than just “(Howing 1994)”. If the reference is to a chapter, give its title, pages, and, if applicable, authors.

Technical reports. In addition to title, authors, year, and report number, you need to provide the address of the publisher (which is usually the authors’ home institution). If the report is available online, give its URL.

Web pages. If you cite a Web page, attempt to find a durable URL that is unlikely to change if, for example, a researcher changes institution. In addition to the usual details, give theURL; they can include unusual characters, somake sure you represent these correctly. It is a preferred practice to also include the date on which the Web page was accessed. However, as for technical reports, it is usually better to refer to such material in a footnote rather than as a formal entry in a bibliography. You should still provide sufficient details, of course, and a durable URL.


### Quotation
Quotations are text from another source, usually included in a paper to support an argument. The copied text, if short, is enclosed in double quotes (which are more visible than single quotes and cannot be confused with apostrophes). Longer quotes are set aside in an indented block


### Acknowledgements
In the acknowledgements of a write-up you should thank everyone who made a con- tribution, whether advice, proofreading, coding, or whatever: include research stu- dents, research assistants, technical support, and colleagues. Funding sources should also be acknowledged. 

There are two common forms of acknowledgement. One is to simply list the people who have helped with the paper.

The other common form is to explain each person’s contribution.


Some authors write their thanks as “I would like to thank” or “I wish to thank”.
To me this seems to imply that I wish to thank …but for some reason I am unable to do so. Consider instead using “I am grateful to” or simply “I thank” or “Thanks to”

### Grammar

based on rules such as don’t split infinitives or don’t begin a sentence with “and” or “but ”

## Style Specfics

Good style is about clear, easy-to-read writing, which can be achieved by follow- ing well-defined guidelines.

### Titles and Headings

Titles of papers and sections should be concise and informative, have specific rather than general terms, and accurately describe the content.

The title is the only part of your paper that most people see; if the title does not reflect the paper’s contents, the paper will not be read by the intended readership.

The title is meant to capture something of the flavour of the contribution, and
should not be misleading as to the scope or outcome of the work.

Section headings should reflect the paper’s structure.

Headings may or may not be numbered. In a paper, my preference is to use
only two levels of headings, major and minor, and to only number major headings. In a thesis, numbered chapters, sections, and possibly subsections, are appropriate.

A paper (or thesis chapter) consists of sections and possibly subsections. There
is rarely any need to break subsections into sub-subsections.

### The Opening Paragraphs

The opening paragraphs can set the reader’s attitude to the whole paper or thesis, so begin well. All of a document should be created and edited with care, but take the most care with the opening, to create the best possible first impression. The abstract should be written especially well, without an unnecessary word, and the opening sentence should be direct and straightforward.

The first paragraphs must be intelligible to any likely reader; save technicalities for later on, so that readers who don’t understand the details of your paper are still able to appreciate your results and the importance of your work. That is, describe what you have done without the details of how it was done. Starting an abstract or introduction with “This paper concerns” or “In this paper” often means that results are going to be stated out of context.

A typical organization for the introduction of a paper is to use the first paragraphs
to describe the context. It is these paragraphs that convince the reader that the paper is likely to be interesting. The opening sentences should clearly indicate the topic.

Take care to distinguish description of existing knowledge from the description
of the paper’s contribution.


### Variation

Diversity—in organization, structure, length of sentences and paragraphs, and word choice—helps to keep the reader’s attention.

### Paragraphing

A paragraph should discuss a single topic or issue. The outline or the argument is typically captured in the first sentence of each paragraph, with the rest of the paragraph used for amplification or example. Every sentence in a paragraph should be on the topic announced in the opening. The last sentence has higher impact than those in the body, so pay attention to sentence order.

Contextual information can be forgotten between paragraphs, and references bet-
ween paragraphs can be difficult to follow.

Formatted lists can be used as an occasional alternative to paragraphs. Lists are useful for the following reasons:
• They highlight each main point clearly. • The context remains obvious, whereas, in a long list of points made in a paragraph, it is hard to tell whether the later points are part of the original issue or belong to some subsequent discussion.
• An individual point can be considered in detail without confusing the main thread of narrative.
• They are easy to refer to.
List points can be numbered, named, or tagged. Use numbers only when ordering or reference is important. If it is necessary to refer to an individual point, use numbers or names. Otherwise use tags, as in the list above. Acceptable tags are bullets and dashes;

Reserve lists for material that is both significant and in need of enumeration.


### Ambiguity


Check carefully for ambiguity.

When using pronouns such as “it”, “this”, and “they”, ensure that the reader knows
what is being referred to.

Another problem with “it” is that it is overused.

Acommon source of confusion is between speed and time. Although not ambiguous, the phrase “increasing speed” is easily read as increasing time, which has the opposite meaning. There are similar problems with phrases such as “improving affordability”.

### Sentence Structure

Sentences should have simple structure, which usually means that they will be no more than a line or two.


It is likewise helpful to avoid nested sentences, that is, information embedded within a sentence that is not part of its main statement.

Nested content, particularly if in parentheses, should be omitted. If such content really is required, then put it in a separate sentence.

Sometimes longer sentences can be divided by, say, simply replacing an “and” or
a semicolon with a full stop. If there is no particular reason to join two sentences, keep them separate. Beware of misplaced modifier.

Organize your sentences so that they can be parsed without too much backtracking. Ambiguous words or phraseology, even if clear in the context of a whole sentence, can slow the reader down.

If an “-ing” suffix can be replaced by “-ation of”, as in this example, then it is probably a good idea to do so.

Build your text from simple sentences and concise paragraphs. To guide analysis
of your writing, ask elementary questions about it. Is each sentence motivated by the preceding text? Can you identify the sentence’s purpose, that is, is it necessary? Could it be simplified? And so on. The habit of careful examination of your text can greatly improve your writing.

### Tense

In science writing, most text is in past or present tense. Present tense is used for eternal truths.

Present tense is also used for statements about the text itself. It is better to write “related issues are discussed below” than to write “related issues will be discussed below”.

Past tense is used for describing work and outcomes.

### Repetition and Parallelism

Text that consists of the same form of sentence used again and again is monotonous. Watch out for sequences ofsentences beginning with “however”, “moreover”, “there- fore”, “hence”, “thus”, “and”, “but”, “then”, “so”, “nevertheless”, or “nonetheless”. Likewise, don’t overuse the pattern “First, … Second, … Last, …”. Complementary concepts should be explained as parallels, or the reader will have
difficulty seeing how the concepts relate to each other.

There are some standard forms of parallel. The phrase “on the one hand” should have a matching “on the other hand”. A sentence beginning “One …” suggests that a sentence beginning “Another …” is imminent. If you flag a point with “First” then every following point should have a similar flag, such as “Second”, “Next”, or “Last”. Parallel structures should be used in lists.

### Emphasis

The structure of a sentence places implicit emphasis, or stress, on some words. Reorganization of a sentence can change the emphasis.


Explicit stress can be provided with italics, but is almost never necessary. Don’t
italicize words unnecessarily—let sentence structure provide the emphasis. Few papers require explicit stress more than once or twice. DON’T use capitals for emphasis. Some authors use the word “emphatic” to provide emphasis, as in “which are emphatically not equivalent”. Other words used in this way are “certainly” and “indeed”. The resulting wordiness weakens rather than strengthens; use of this form of emphasis should be rare.


### Definitions

Terminology, variables, abbreviations, and acronyms should be defined or explained the first time they are used. Definitions should be specific and concrete.


### Choice ofWords

Use short, direct words rather than long, circumlocutionary ones; the result is vig- orous, emphatic writing. For example, use “begin” rather than “initiate”, “first” and “second” rather than “firstly” and “secondly”, “part” rather than “component”, and “use” rather than “utilize”. Use short words in preference to long, but use an exact long word rather than an approximate short one.

Other abstract terms that are overused include “important”, “intelligent”,
“method”, “paradigm”, “performance”, and “semantic”. “Difficult” is often used when a better term is available: if something is “difficult to compute”, does that mean that it is slow, or memory-hungry, or requires double precision, or something else altogether? “Hard” is sometimes used poorly too, including cases when “diffi- cult” would be a better choice; remember that “hard” also means inflexible or rigid and can be misunderstood. “Efficient” is another word that is often vague. Use the most precise term available.

A common reason for using vague terms is that some authors feel they are writing
badly if they use the same word twice in a sentence or paragraph, and thus substitute a synonym, which is usually less specific.

The “don’t repeat words” rule might apply to creative writing, but not to technical terms that must be clearly understood.

Use a word only if you are sure that you know the meaning and can apply it cor-
rectly. Other words, such as “notwithstanding”, “whilst”, and “amongst”, have an archaic feel and can seem out of place in newwriting.

Slang should not be used in technical writing. Nor should the choice ofwords sug-
gest that the writing is careless; avoid sloppy-looking abbreviations and contractions. Use “cannot” in preference to “can’t”, for example.

Don’t make excessive claims about your own work. Phrases such as “our method
is an ideal solution to these problems” or “ourwork is remarkable” are not acceptable. Claims about your own work should be unarguable.

### Qualifiers

Don’t pile qualifiers on top ofone another.Within a sentence, use atmost one qualifier such as “might”, “may”, “perhaps”, “possibly”, “likely”, “likelihood”, or “could”. Overuse of qualifiers results in text that is lame and timid.

Double negatives are a form of qualifier; they are commonly used to express uncertainty.

Qualifiers such as “very” and “quite” should be avoided, because they are in
effect meaningless. If an algorithm is “very fast”, is an algorithm that is merely “fast” deficient in some way? Writing is invariably more forceful without “very”.

Likewise, “simply” can often be deleted.

Other words of this kind are “totally”, “completely”, “truly”, “highly”, “usually”, “accordingly”, “certainly”, “necessarily”, and “somewhat”.

### Misused Words

The Table 7.1 lists words that are often used incorrectly because of confusion with another word of similar form or sound. The “usually correct” form is shown on the left; the form with which each word gets confused is shown on the right.

Which, that, the. Many writers use “which” when “that” is appropriate. Use “which” only when it cannot be replaced by “that”.

The word “that” is often underused. Use of “that” can make a sentence seem stilted, but its absence can make the sentence unclear.

On the other hand, “the” is often used unnecessarily; delete it where doing so does not change the meaning.

Less, fewer. Use “less” for continuous quantities (“it used less space”) and “fewer” for discrete quantities (“there were fewer errors”).

Affect, effect. The “effect”, or consequence, of an action is to “affect”, or influence, outcomes.
Alternate, alternative, choice. The word “alternate” means other or switch between, whereas an “alternative” is something that can be chosen. Strictly speaking, if there is only one alternative, no choice is available; “alternative” and “choice” are not synonyms.
Assume, presume. “Assume” means for now, take as being true, while “presume” means take for granted. A fact is assumed as the basis of an argument, an event is presumed to have occurred.
May, might, can. Many writers use “may” or “might” when they mean “can”. Use “may” to indicate personal choice, and “can” to indicate capability.

Basic, fundamental. Somewriters confuse “basic”with “fundamental”: the former means elementary as well as a foundation. A result should only be described as “basic” if elementary is meant, or readers may get the wrong idea.
Novel, complex, sophisticated. “Sophisticated” does not mean new or novel,but either advanced or complex. Use “novel” or “complex” if these meanings are intended.
Will, shall. The word “shall” can seem archaic and is rarely preferable to “will”. Both “will” and “shall” are often used unnecessarily and in many cases can be deleted.
Compile, compose. In general usage, “compile” means assemble, gather,or col- lect, but it has such a strong specific meaning in computing that it should not be used for other purposes. To “compose” is to invent or perhaps prepare; it is not a synonym of “compile”, even though “composed of” means made up of.
Conflate, merge, confuse. The word “conflate” means regard distinct things as similar, while “merge” means join distinct things to form one new thing.Iftwo things are “confused”, then one has been mistaken for the other. These three terms are not equivalent.
Continual, continuous. “Continual” is not equivalent to “continuous”. The former means ceaselessly; the latter means unbroken.
Conversely, inversely, similarly, likewise. Only use “conversely” if the statement that follows really is the opposite of the preceding material. Don’t use “similarly” or “likewise” unless whatever follows has a strong parallel to the preceding material. Some authors use “inversely”, but the meaning is rarely clear; avoid it.

Fast, quickly, presently, timely, currently. A process is “fast” if it runs quickly; “quickly” means fast, but does not necessarily mean in the near future. Something is “timely” if it is opportune; timeliness has nothing to do with rapidity. Also on the subject of time, “presently” means soon, whereas “currently” means at present.

Optimize, minimize, maximize. Absolute terms are often misused. One suchword is “optimize”, whichmeans findan optimum or find the best solution, but is often used to mean improve. The latter usage is now so common that it could be argued that the meaning of“optimize” has changed, but as there is no synonym for “optimize” such a change would be unfortunate. Other absolute terms that are misused are “maximize” and “minimize”.
Overlook, oversee, oversight. To “overlook” is to fail to notice, or to ignore.To “oversee” is to manage or look after. They are not synonyms! Even more confusingly, “oversight” means both of these things.4
Theory, hypothesis, proposition, supposition. These words are used in a wide variety ofways across the discipline. In some areas, “theory” is used in a strict sense, of a hypothesis that has been confirmed by analysis or experiment. But in some areas it is used more or less equivalently to “proposition”, in the sense ofa concept that is to be tested. Sometimes “proposition” is used to mean assumption, as is “supposition”. That is, these terms are used both formally and loosely, in ways that can be deeply inconsistent with each other. As in other cases, be alert to the conventions within your discipline, but it is helpful to use these terms in ways that are consistent with their formal meaning, as they are part of the fundamental principles of science.

### Spelling Conventions

A finished manuscript should as nearly as possible be free of spelling errors.
To ensure that all errors have been found it is essential to use a spell checker, but
you should also take the effort to find mistakes by hand.

Other words that don’t have a stable spelling include “enquire” (“inquire”), “biased” (“biassed”), and “dispatch” (“despatch”).

The English-speaking countries have different spelling conventions. For example,
the American “traveler” becomes the British “traveller” while “fulfill” becomes “ful- fil”. In Britain it is incorrect to spell “-our” words as “-or”, but, for example, “vigour” and “vigorous” are both correct.5 TheAmerican “center” is the British “centre”, “pro- gram” is “programme” (except for computer program), “catalog” and “analog” are “catalogue” and “analogue”, “acknowledgment” is “acknowledgement”, and “judg- ment” is “judgement”. Another confusion is with regard to the suffixes “-ize” and “-yze”, which have the same recommended spelling in both countries, but are often spelt as “-ise” and “-yse” outside the United States

The most important thing is to spell consistently and to be consistent with suffixes such as “-ize” without intro- ducing errors such as “expertize” or “otherwize”.


### Jargon

The word “jargon” means terms used in a specialized vocabulary or mode ofspeech familiar only to a group or profession.

### Cliché and Idiom

Some expressions are clichés, that is, stock phrases whose meaning has little rela- tionship to their words. Many readers, especially those from other cultures, may misunderstand such phrases. Examples include “follow suit”, “up to scratch”, “rein- vent the wheel”, “go through with a fine-tooth comb”, “flat out”, “cut and dried”, and “bells and whistles”. Idiomatic phrases are also poor choices in scientific writing, for similar reasons. Examples include “crop up”, “lose track”, “come to grips with”, “it turned out that”, “play up”, “stacked deck”, and “right out”. Do not use such phrases.

### Overuse of Words

Repetition of a word is annoying when it makes the reader feel they have read the same phrase twice, or have read a phrase and an inversion of it.

Repetition should be eliminated when the same word is used in different senses, or when a word and a synonym of it are used together.

Some words grate when they are used too frequently. Common offenders include
“this”, “very”, and “case”. Other words are even more memorable—unusual words, other than technical terms, should only be used once or twice in a paper. Watch out for tics: excessive use of some stockword or phrase. Typical tics include “so”, “also”, “hence”, “note that”, and “thus”.

There are cases in which repetition is useful. In the phrase “discrete quantities and continuous quantities”, the first “quantities” can be omitted, but such omissions are often ambiguous and can result in text that is difficult to parse.

### Padding

Padding is the unnecessary use ofpedantic phrases such as “in general”, which should usually be deleted, not least because they are irritating.

The phrase “of course” can be patronizing or even insulting—“of course it is now clear that that the order is stable”. The phrases “note that” and “the fact that” are not padding, but are often used to introduce something that readers should be able to deduce for themselves. Phrases involving the word “case” (“in any case”, “it is perhaps the case”) are
also suspect. There is rarely a reason to use “it is frequently the case that” instead of “often”, for example. Unnecessary introduction of quantities, or the concept of quantities, is a form of padding. For example, the phrase “a number of” can be replaced by “several”, and “a large number of” by “many”. Adjectives are another form of padding.

Use the minimum number of words, of minimum length, in your writing. The
Table 7.2 lists common redundant or wordy expressions and possible substitutes for them.


### Plurals

Acommon problem in English for writers educated in another language is agreement of plurals—a plural noun can require a differently formed verb to that required by a singular noun.

Consider proofreading your paper just to check for plural agreement.

### Abbreviations

It is often tempting to use abbreviations such as “no.”, “i.e.”, “e.g.”, “c.f.”, and “w.r.t.” These save a little space on the page, but slow readers down. It is almost always desirable to expand these abbreviations, to “number”, “that is”, “for example”, “compared with” (or more accurately “in contrast to”, since that is the sense in which “c.f.” should be used), and “with respect to”, or synonyms of these expressions.

Also consider expanding abbreviations such as “Fig.” and “Alg.” (but note that the contracted form is the preferred style for some journals), and don’t use concoctions such as “1st” or “2nd”. Months should not be abbreviated. Make sure that all abbreviations and acronyms are explained when they are first used.

Avoid use of “etc.” and “and so on”. They are clumsy, and sometimes patronizing,
as they can imply that the reader ought to be able to complete the list without the author’s help.

A slash, also known as a virgule or solidus, is often used for abbreviation, as in
“save time and/or space” or “used for list/tree processing”. Use of slashes betrays confusion, since it is often not clear whether the intended meaning is or (in the usual English sense of either but not both), or (in the usual computing sense of either or both), and,or also. If you want to be clear, don’t use slashes.

An exception is “I/O”, meaning input and output.

### Acronyms 

In technical documentswith many compound terms it can be helpful to use acronyms, but as with abbreviations they can confuse the reader.

Abbreviations end with a stop but it is unusual to put stops in acronyms.
Thus “CPU” is correct, “C.P.U.” is acceptable, and “CPU.” is incorrect. Plurals of acronyms don’t require an apostrophe; write “CPUs” rather than “CPU’s”.

### Sexism
Forms of expression that unnecessarily specify gender are widely regarded as sexist. In technical writing, sexist usage is easy to avoid.

The first use of “they”, as a singular pronoun, is acceptable but, to some readers, jarring. The second use, as a plural, removes sexism at the cost of clarity. It is preferable to recast the sentence.

Don’t use ugly constructs such as “s/he” or engage in reverse sexism by using “she” unless it is absolutely impossible to avoid a generic reference. Remember that some readers find use of “he” or “his” for a generic case offensive and dislike writing that employs such usage.

## Punctuation

Some authors prefer bold to italic for emphasis, but bold print is distracting.

Visual clutter of any kind is distracting and should be eliminated unless there is
a clear need for it. Emphasis is one kind of clutter. Another is the use of graphic devices such as boxes around important points or icons next to results. Yet another kind of clutter is punctuation: excessive use of parentheses, quotes, italics, hyphens, semicolons, and uppercase letters.

Indentation is an important tool of layout, used primarily to indicate the start of a new paragraph. Some authors prefer to use a blank line instead, a decision that is often unwise; the meaning is unclear at a page break, for example. Changes of topic should be signalled by headings. Indentation is also used to offset material that is not part of the textual flow, such as quotes, programs, and displayed mathematics.

### Stops

Stops (or full-stops or periods) end sentences.

Stops are also used in abbreviations, acronyms, and ellipses. When these occur at
the end of sentence, the sentence’s stop is omitted. Problems with stops are a good reason to avoid abbreviations.


It is not usual to put a stop at the end of a heading.

### Commas

The primary uses of commas are to mark pauses, indicate the correct parsing, form lists, and indicate that a phrase is a parenthetical remark (that is, a comment) rather than a qualifier

Use the minimum number of commas needed to avoid ambiguity. Sentences
with many commas often have strangulated syntax; if the commas seem necessary, consider breaking the sentence into shorter ones or rewriting it altogether. But don’t omit too many commas.

Another exception to the minimal-commas rule is in lists. A simple example of a list is “the structures were arrays, trees, and hash tables”. Many authors (and editors) prefer to omit the last comma from a list, known as the serial comma, a process that rarely adds clarity and often does it serious damage.

### Colons and Semicolons

Colons are used to join related statements.

Colons are also used to introduce lists.

The elements in a list can be separated by semicolons, allowing commas or other marks within each element.

A semicolon can also be used to divide a long sentence, or to set off part of a sentence for emphasis.

Colons and semicolons are valuable but should not be overused.

### Apostrophes

Singular possessives such as “the student’s algorithm”, “Brandt’s book”, and “Su and Ling’s method” require an apostrophe and an “s”. (Some people would write “Su’s and Ling’s method”, which is fine too.) For some names ending in “-s”, such as in “Williams’s book”, you can optionally omit the “s” after the apostrophe. If you are unsure, then the “s” should be given.
• Plural possessives such as “students’ passwords” require an apostrophe but no “s”. • Pronoun possessives such as “its” (as in “its speed”) and “hers” do not require an apostrophe.
• Contractions such as “it’s” (as in “it is blue”) and “can’t” require an apostrophe; but note that contractions should be avoided in technical writing.

Other than in the cases above, apostrophes are not required.

### Exclamations

Avoid exclamation marks! Never use more than one!! The proper place for an exclamationmark is after an exclamation (such as “Oh!”—
not a common expression in technical writing), or, rarely, after a genuine surprise.

### Hyphenation


there are three different “dash” symbols: the hyphen “-” used for joining
words, theminus sign or en-dash “–” used in arithmetic and for ranges such as “pages 101–127”, and the em-dash “—” used for punctuation.


### Capitalization

Today, only proper names are capitalized, and even these can be in lowercase if the name is in common use;

Headings can be either minimally or maximally capitalized. In the former, words
are capitalized as they would be in normal text, except that the word following a colon is capitalized.

Be consistent in your style of capitalization. It is acceptable to use maximum capitalization for sections and minimum capitalization for subsections, but not the other way around.

### Parentheses
A sentence containing a statement in parentheses should be punctuated exactly as if the parenthetical statement was not there.

Parenthetical remarks should be asides that the reader can ignore—important text should not be in parentheses. In particular, don’t introduce information in parentheses that is referred to later. The same rule applies to footnotes. If you think some text should be relegated to a footnote, perhaps it can be deleted. Overuse ofparentheses looks crowded.Avoid havingmore than one parenthesized
remark per paragraph, or more than a couple per page. Parentheses within parentheses are hard to read and look like typing errors. Get rid of them.

### Citations

Citations should be punctuated as if they were parenthetical remarks.

The cite should be close to the material it relates to—poor placement of cites can be ambiguous.


## Graphs, Figures, and Tables

Well-chosen illustrations breathe life into a paper, giving the reader interesting visual elements to browse and highlighting the central results and ideas. A typical figure consists of visual matter such as a graph or diagram, or of textual matter such as a table, algorithm, or, less commonly, complex mathematics. Some information is best presented in a pictorial form, such as a graph or figure, to show trends and relationships. Other information is best as a table, to show regularities.

Graphs
Graphs are often the best way to present numerical results.

Graphs should be simple, with no more than a few plotted lines and a minimum
of clutter. If the graph is being used to demonstrate variation in output values for a range of input values, the horizontal or x-axis should be used for the parameter being varied, or the input; the vertical or y-axis is for the function of the parameter, or the output. Plotted lines of discrete data should always have points marked by distinctive marks such as circles, boxes, or triangles.

Consider using greys, colours, or line thickness rather than dots and dashes to distinguish between lines.


Colours are more eye-catching than are greys, but, in a graph, do not necessarily communicate better. First, some journals do not print in colour. Second, colours can render inconsistently in different media;

Third, greys are emotionally neutral, and thus don’t carry the subconscious messages that colours can.

Minimize use of unnecessary elements and remove all decoration. Are the sec-
ondary ticks on the axes useful? If not, discard them. Is a legend necessary? If not, remove it, and label the lines directly. Do the captions have to be in a large font? If not, diminish them. Are the fonts and font sizes different to those of the rest of the paper? If so, change them. Axes should be inconspicuous; ink should be used for data, not dressing. Gridlines and boxing are other forms of unnecessary ornamen- tation. Secondary marks, such as axis ticks, should be a little lighter than the other elements. The lines and other elements should be of similar weight—don’t mix a large, bold font with lightly drawn lines, for example.

Graph-drawing tools allow bar graphs to be three dimensional, but the addition
of depth is deceptive; if one bar is twice the height of another, the depth exaggerates the difference.

Diagrams
Diagrams serve many purposes in computing papers. They illustrate processes or architectures, explain data structures and algorithms, present relationships, visual- ize data, and show examples of interfaces.

To design a diagram that is to be created with a manual tool, the first step is often
to do initial sketches by hand, on paper. This early stage is the appropriate time to balance the diagram, by checking that it is well-proportioned, makes good use of the space, is laid out well and doesn’t have the elements bunched to one side, and is arranged so that the relative sizes of the elements look reasonable.

However, never submit a paper with a hand-drawn diagram unless it has been prepared by a profes- sional; almost any diagram can be drawn well with the tools available for a typical computer.

Illustrations are covered by copyright; figures from another source can only be
re-used with permission of the author and the publisher of the original. If you wish to re-use a figure, get permission to do so and identify the original author and source, preferably in the caption.

Tables
Tables are used for presentation of information that is unsuitable for graphs or figures, such as the properties of each of a series of datasets or data where the exact values are important.

A well-designed table has a logical hierarchical structure. Simple tables are an arrangement of columns and rows, in which each column has a heading at the top and each row has a label or stub at the left.
In more complex tables, columns and rows may be partitioned or have internal structure. The hierarchy can be indicated in several ways: rows or columns can be separated by double lines, single lines, or white space; headings can span several columns; labels can refer to several rows. Deeper structure—which is sometimes necessary but is usually unwise—can be indicated by markup within the table such as embedded headings.

In most tables no position should be blank; if there is no applicable value, put in a dash, and explain somewhere what it means. Values of the same units in a column should be aligned in a logical way. Numbers should be aligned on the decimal point.

Captions and Labels
Captions and labels should be informative. Though it is common for captions to be only a few words, it is preferable for captions to fully describe the figure’s major elements.

Full captions assist the reader who is skimming the paper or referring back to earlier figures and tables. Use either minimum or maximum capitalization, but minimum is better, particularly if the caption is a description rather than a label. Use italics for the caption so that it is distinct from other text. The caption is usually placed below a figure, but above a table.

Since figures and tables should be fairly self-contained, the caption is an appro- priate place to explain important details, especially since these would otherwise interrupt the flow of the main text. The caption can also be used to expand abbreviations or notation used in headings.

Each figure and table should be numbered to allow easy reference. If your word
processor does not provide automatic numbering, you must number the figures your- self. A figure is usually at the top or the bottom of a page, or on a page by itself, to set it apart from ordinary text. A figure or table should always be introduced and discussed in the main text, preferably just before or on the page on which it occurs.

Axes, Labels, and Headings

The space constraints on axes, labels, and headings may mean that some terms have to be abbreviated; Where appropriate, units should be stated in labels. Write “Size (bytes)”, not just “Size”.

## Editing

The writing of a paper begins with a rough draft, perhaps based on records of experiments or sketches of a couple of theorems. It will probably include mater- ial produced during the project, such as notes taken in meetings, reviews of litera- ture, emails discussing the research question, and text from sources such as progress reports. The next phase usually consists of filling out the draft to form a contiguous whole: explaining concepts, adding background material, arranging the structure to give a logical flow of ideas. Finally, the paper is polished by correcting mistakes, improving written expression, and taking care of layout. Although it does not change the quality of the research, it is this last phase—the styling of the paper—that has the most impact on a reader. It should not be neglected, however strong the ideas being communicated.

The difference between a weak writer and a strong writer is, often, not the ability to write fluently, but the effort taken to diligently edit and revise.

Consistency
Editing is the process of making a document ready for publication or examination. Much of editing consists of checking the document for errors that fall under the heading of consistency (or lack of it).

A surprisingly effective editing exercise is to pretend to be a reader, a member ofthe paper’s intended audience. This shift offramework, ofconsciously adopting the position ofcritic, often exposes problems that otherwise go unnoticed.

For many papers, editing leads to removal of text. Don’t be afraid to shorten
your papers: cutting will improve the quality. Edit for brevity and balance. Omit or condense any material whose content or relevance to the paper’s main themes does not justify its length.

Style
Another kind of editing is for style and clarity, and is perhaps the hardest part of finishing a paper.

Proofreading 193
There is no excuse for a report that contains spelling errors. They jump out and glare, displaying not only your inability to spell, but also your casual attitude to your work.

But spell checkers won’t find missing words, repeated words, or misused words, or correctly handle names. Nor will they find misspellings that form another correct word; a typical example is the substitution of “or” for “on” or “of”.

A common error of mine is, when intending to type a word, to instead type
some other word that shares a few initial letters. A related error is that of replacing words by their anagrams; I type “being” for “begin”, “form” for “from”, “relation” for “relative”, “compute” for “complete”, and so on. I also replace words by their homonyms, such as “two” for “too”.

Typical examples include incom-
plete sentences and sentences that have been run together inappropriately. Check for errors in tense and in number, that is, in the use of plural and singular forms.

Many papers are completed without ever having been printed, but most people
read more carefully away from the computer than they do at a screen—ifonly because there are fewer distractions. It is vital to read your paper at least once in its entirety, to check flow and consistency. Set the draft aside for a day or two before proofreading it yourself, as doing so increases the likelihood of finding mistakes.


Read each sentence carefully, and ask yourself how easy it is to understand.

It is particularly important to check the bibliography. Readers will use it to track
down references, so any garbling of information can lead them astray, and other writers may be offended if you have misreferenced their papers. Format should be consistent and each reference should include enough information to allow readers to locate it.

Always get someone else to read your work before you submit it or distribute it.

An “Editing” Checklist

Are all of the components present: title, authors, abstract, and so on? • Are the acknowledgements complete and accurate? • Is the ordering of material correct? • Are the titles and headings consistent with the content? • Have all terms been defined? • Is the style of definition consistent? For example, were all new terms introduced in italics, or only some?
• Has terminology been used consistently? • Are defined objects always described in the same way? For example, if you use the expression “all regular elements E” when introducing a concept, but the shorter form “all elements E” in later references, is “regular” implicit in the latter expression?
• Are abbreviations and acronyms stated in full when first used? Are any abbrevia- tions or acronyms introduced more than once? Are the full statements subsequently used unnecessarily?
• Are any abbreviations used less than, say, four times? If not, can they be removed? • Do all headings have maximum or minimum capitalization? Has a term been capitalized in one place and not in another?
• Is the style and wording of headings and captions consistent? • Are names always used in the same way? Has a consistent convention been used for the formation of new names?
• Is spelling consistent? What about “-ise” versus “-ize”, “dispatch” versus “despatch”, or “disc” versus “disk”?
• Is tense used correctly? Are references discussed in a consistent way? • Have bold and italic been used logically? • Are any words hyphenated in some places but not others? • Have units been used logically? Ifmilliseconds have been used for somemeasure- ments and microseconds for others, is there a logical reason for doing so? Is the reason clear to the reader? Has “megabyte” been written as “Mb” in some places and “Mbyte” in others?
• Are all values of the same type presented with the same precision? • Are the graphs all the same size? Are the axis units always given? If, say, the x-axes on different graphs measure the same units, do the axes have the same label?
• Are all tables in the same format? Does the use of double and single lines follow a logical pattern? Are units given for every value? Are labels and headings named consistently? If, say, columns have been used for properties A to E in one table, have rows been used elsewhere? That is, do all tables have the same orientation?
• Does every figure and table have a caption?
Has the same style been used for all algorithms and programs? Is there a consistent scheme for naming of variables? Do all pseudocode statements have the same syntax? Is the use of indentation consistent?
• In the references, has each field been formatted consistently? Have italics and quotes been used appropriately for titles? Is capitalization consistent? Are journal and conference names abbreviated in the same way? Is the style of author names consistent? Has the same core set of fields been provided for each reference of the same type?
• Is formatting consistent? Has the same indentation been used for all displays? Are some displays centred and others indented? Do some sections begin with an unindented paragraph and others not? • Do the parentheses match?
