# Summary

## Starting Your PhD

### Scientific Publications

Scientific publications can be of different types:

1. Book
2. Thesis
3. Journal Article: Typically an end product of the research process,
4. A Paper or extended abstract (detail of work is omitted) in a conference or workshop proceedings, or a manuscript: Can be an end-product, but mostly work in progress.

### Starting a research

1. Formation of a precise question aka the aim of the research.
2. Development of a detailed understanding: Literature Review/ Related work - reading and critical analysis of scientific literature and other resources.
3. Gathering of evidence related to the question, through experiment, analysis, or theory. These are intended to support—or disprove—the hypothesis underlying the question.
4. Linking of the question and evidence with an argument, that is, a chain of reasoning.
5. Description of the work in a publication.

Experienced scientists aiming to write a paper on a reserach subject tend to be fairly focused: they quickly design a series of experiments or theoretical goals, investigate the relevant literature, and set deadlines.

Larger research program such as a Ph.D., there are

- short-term goals: Include the current specific explorations, which may be intended to lead to an initial research paper; short-term research goals gives shape to a research program.
- long-term goals: are the wider investigation that will eventually form the basis of the student’s thesis.

Typical research project has just one deadline: completion! There might be few administrative requirements such as submission of a project outline or a progress report, but many students (and advisors) do not take these milestones seriously.

PhD Thesis is the only part which is assessed. It is a mistake, for example, to implement a complete system rather than ask what code is needed to explore the research questions.
explicitly consider what is needed at the end, then reason backwards. The final thing required is the write-up in the form of a thesis, paper, or report; so you need to plan in terms of the steps necessary to produce the write-up. the write-up is likely to involve a background review, explanations ofprevious and newalgorithms, descriptions of experiments, and analysis of outcomes. Completion of each of these elements is a milestone.

### Charactertics shared by sucessful reserach students

1. show a willingness to read widely, to explore the field broadly beyond their specific topic, to try things out, and to generally take part in the academic community.
2. have the enthusiasm to develop their interest in some area, and then ask for advice on how that interest can be turned into a thesis project.
3. have the ability and persistence to undertake a detailed (and even gruelling) investigation of a specific facet of a larger topic
4. take the initiative in terms of what needs to be done and how to present it, and gradually assume responsibility for all aspects of the research
5. systematic and organized, and understand the need for rigour, discipline, stringency, quality, and high standards.
6. they actively reflect on habits and working practices, and seek to improve themselves and overcome their limitations and knowledge gaps.
7. work looks plausible; it has the form and feel of high-quality published papers
8. Have the strength to keep working despite some significant failed or unsuccessful activity; in a Ph.D., loss of months of work is not unusual.
9. Note that neither “brilliance” nor “genius” is in this list.

### Getting Started Checklist

- Is your proposed topic clearly a research activity? Is it consistent with the aims and purposes of research?
- How is your project different from, say, software development, essay writing, or data analysis?
- In the context of your project, what are the area, topic, and research question? (How are these concepts distinct from each other?)
- Is the project of appropriate scale, with challenges that are a match to your skills and interests? Is the question narrowenough to give you confidence that the project is achievable?
- Is the project distinct from other active projects in your research group? Is it clear that the anticipated outcomes are interesting enough to justify the work?
- Is it clear what skills and contributions you bring to the project, and what will be contributed by your advisor? What skills do you need to develop?
- What resources are required and how will you obtain them? • What are the likely obstacles to completion, or the greatest difficulties? Do you know how these will be addressed?
- Can you write down a road map, with milestones, that provides a clear path to the anticipated research outcomes?
- Do you and your advisor have an agreed method for working together, with a defined schedule of meetings?

## Research Literature

Reading achieves several aims such as establishing your work is indeed novel or innovative; it helps you to understand current theory, discoveries, debates. It can identify new lines ofquestioning or investigation; and it should provide alternative perspectives on your work. This reading will ultimately be summarized in the background sections and the discussions of related work in your write-ups.

### Finding research papers

1. Explore [Scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com)
2. Visit the websites of research groups and researchers working in the area.
3. Explore important conferences to your area and search [DBLP Computer Science Bibliography](https://dblp.org/) for papers in that particular conference.
4. Explore the references in the paper X, who cited that paper X via [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/).
5. Keep searching and reading as separate activities.

### Critical Reading

Read papers by asking critical questions of them, such as:

- Is there a contribution? Is it significant?
- Is the contribution of interest?
- Are the results correct?
- Is the appropriate literature discussed?
- Does the methodology actually answer the initial question?
- Are the proposals and results critically analyzed?
- Are appropriate conclusions drawn from the results, or are there other possible interpretations?
- Are all the technical details correct? Are they sensible?
- Could the results be verified?
- Are there any serious ambiguities or inconsistencies?

The above questions also provide a hint on how a reserach paper should be written and should contain.

### Literature Review

A literature review is a structured analysis of a body of literature, and may cover work from several separate areas of research.

Rather, the papers should be grouped by topic, and critically discussed in a way that allows the reader to understand their contribution to the field, their limitations, and the questions that they leave open.

Begin a rough literature review as soon as you start reading, and, when you read a paper that you think will need to be discussed, add it in. Briefly summarize each paper’s contribution and the evidence used to support the claims, and also note any shortcomings or features that are of interest. For your own reference, how the work might have been done better: for example, are there obvious experiments that should have been tried, or plausible counter-arguments to the claims?

Keep in mind that your understanding of other work helps examiners to judge your abilities as a researcher.

## Reviewing Papers

### Contribution

Contribution is the main criterion for judging a paper. A paper is a contribution if it has two properties: originality and validity. The originality of a paper is the degree to which the ideas presented are significant, new, and interesting. Most papers are to some degree extensions or variations of previously published work; really groundbreaking ideas are rare.

### Evaluation of Papers

• Is the contribution timely or only of historical interest?
• Is the topic relevant to the venue’s typical readership?
• What is missing? What would complete the presentation? Is any of the material unnecessary?
• How broad is the likely readership?
• Can the paper be understood? Is it clearly written? Is the presentation at an adequate standard?
• Does the content justify the length?

Most papers have an explicit or implicit hypothesis—some assertion that is claimed to be true—and a proposal or innovation. Try to identify what the hypothesis is.
The quality of a paper can be reflected in its bibliography. For example, how many references are there?

### Checklist

When you recommend that a paper be accepted, you should:

- Convince yourself that it has no serious defects.
- Convince the editor that it is of an acceptable standard, by explaining why it is original, valid, and clear.
- List the changes, major and minor, that should be made before it appears in print, and where possible help the author by indicating not just what to change but what to change it to; but if there are excessive numbers of errors of some kind, you may instead want to give a few examples and recommend that the paper be proofread.
- Take reasonable care in checking details such as mathematics, formulas, and the bibliography.

When you recommend that a paper be rejected, or recommend that it be resubmitted after major changes, you should:

- Give a clear explanation of the faults and, where possible, discuss how they could be rectified.
- Indicate which parts of the work are of value and which should be discarded, that is, discuss what you believe the contribution to be.
- Check the paper to a reasonable level of detail, unless it is unusually sloppy or ill-thought.

In either case you should:

- Provide good references with which the authors should be familiar.
- Ask yourself whether your comments are fair, specific, and polite.
- Be honest about your limitations as a referee of that paper.
- Check your review as carefully as you would check one of your own papers prior to submission.

## Hypothesis, Questions and Evidence

The first stages of a research program involve choice of interesting topics or problems, and then identification of particular issues to investigate. The research is given direction by development of specific questions that the program aims to answer.

Questions are based on an understanding—an informal model, perhaps—of how something works, or interacts, or behaves. They establish a framework for making observations about the object being studied. This framework can be characterised as a statement of belief about how the object behaves—in other words, a hypothesis. Many hypotheses concern some aspect of the physical world: whether something is occurring, whether it is possible to alter something in a predictable way, or whether a model is able to accurately predict new events.

A hypothesis or research question should be specific and precise, and should be unambiguous; the more loosely a concept is defined, the more easily it will satisfy many needs simultaneously, even when these needs are contradictory.

A hypothesis must be testable.
A hypothesis should be capable of falsification.

### Defending Hypothesis

One component ofa strong paper is a precise, interesting hypothesis.Another component is the testing of the hypothesis and the presentation of the supporting evidence.

In presenting the hypothesis, you need to construct an argument relating your hypothesis to the evidence.

A paper can be viewed as an assembly of evidence and supporting explanations; that is, as an attempt to persuade others to share your conclusions.

There are, broadly speaking, four kinds of evidence that can be used to support a hypothesis:

- proof: An proof is a formal argument that a hypothesis is correct (or wrong)., - modelling: A model is a mathematical description of the hypothesis (or some compo-nent of the hypothesis, such as an algorithm whose properties are being considered) and there will usually be a demonstration that the hypothesis and model do indeedcorrespond.
- simulation: A simulation is usually an implementation or partial implementation of a simplified form of the hypothesis, in which the difficulties of a full implementation are sidestepped by omission or approximation.
- experiment: An experiment is a full test of the hypothesis, based on an
implementation of the proposal and on real—or highly realistic—data.

a paper must be persuasive. Your written work is the one chance
to persuade readers to accept the ideas, and they will only do so if the evidence and arguments are complete and convincing.
