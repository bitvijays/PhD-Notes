## Hypothesis, Questions and Evidence

The first stages of a research program involve choice of interesting topics or problems, and then identification of particular issues to investigate. The research is given direction by development of specific questions that the program aims to answer.

Questions are based on an understanding—an informal model, perhaps—of how something works, or interacts, or behaves. They establish a framework for making observations about the object being studied. This framework can be characterised as a statement of belief about how the object behaves—in other words, a hypothesis. Many hypotheses concern some aspect of the physical world: whether something is occurring, whether it is possible to alter something in a predictable way, or whether a model is able to accurately predict new events.

A hypothesis or research question should be specific and precise, and should be unambiguous; the more loosely a concept is defined, the more easily it will satisfy many needs simultaneously, even when these needs are contradictory.

A hypothesis must be testable.
A hypothesis should be capable of falsification.

### Defending Hypothesis

One component ofa strong paper is a precise, interesting hypothesis.Another component is the testing of the hypothesis and the presentation of the supporting evidence.

In presenting the hypothesis, you need to construct an argument relating your hypothesis to the evidence.

A paper can be viewed as an assembly of evidence and supporting explanations; that is, as an attempt to persuade others to share your conclusions.

There are, broadly speaking, four kinds of evidence that can be used to support a hypothesis:

- proof: An proof is a formal argument that a hypothesis is correct (or wrong).
- modelling: A model is a mathematical description of the hypothesis (or some compo-nent of the hypothesis, such as an algorithm whose properties are being considered) and there will usually be a demonstration that the hypothesis and model do indeedcorrespond.
- simulation: A simulation is usually an implementation or partial implementation of a simplified form of the hypothesis, in which the difficulties of a full implementation are sidestepped by omission or approximation.
- experiment: An experiment is a full test of the hypothesis, based on an
implementation of the proposal and on real—or highly realistic—data.

a paper must be persuasive. Your written work is the one chance
to persuade readers to accept the ideas, and they will only do so if the evidence and arguments are complete and convincing.

### Hypothesis, Questions and evidence checklist

Regarding hypotheses and questions,

- What phenomena or properties are being investigated? Why are they of interest? - Has the aim of the research been articulated? What are the specific hypotheses and research questions? Are these elements convincingly connected to each other?
- What are the underlying assumptions? Are they sensible?
- What would disprove the hypothesis? Does it have any improbable consequences? - To what extent is the work innovative? Is this reflected in the claims?
- Has the work been critically questioned? Have you satisfied yourself that it is sound science?

Regarding evidence and measurement,

- What forms of evidence are to be used? If it is a model or a simulation, what demonstrates that the results have practical validity?
- How is the evidence to be measured? Are the chosen methods of measurement objective, appropriate, and reasonable?
- What are the qualitative aims, and what makes the quantitative measures you have chosen appropriate to those aims?
- Will the outcomes be predictive?
- What compromises or simplifications are inherent in your choice of measure?
- What is the argument that will link the evidence to the hypothesis?
- To what extent will positive results persuasively confirm the hypothesis? Will negative results disprove it?
- What are the likely weaknesses of or limitations to your approach?
