## Writing Paper in LateX

### Very Important

1. Abstract, introduction and conclusion all should sync up. Reviewers make their mind in first 5-10 mins if they are going to accept or reject the draft.

### Diagrams

1. Legends in the graph can be inside the figure to save spaces. (Assuming, your diagrams are made in PGFPlot).

### Bibliography

1. Probably, Bibliography should only contain journal, conference papers, technical reports; it should not contain much URLs. URLs should be in the footnotes. However, this differs from supervisors to supervisors. Kindly ask your supervisor whether they would like URLs in the footnote or in the Bibliography.
